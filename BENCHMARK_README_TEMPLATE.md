## Overview
This benchmark evaluates the performance of large language models on [describe the specific task - e.g., "extracting bibliographic information from historical documents"]. The benchmark consists of [number] images containing [describe the content of the images, e.g., "19th century newspaper articles", "handwritten letters", etc.].

## Creator
This benchmark was created by [individual/organization name] ([contact information]) in [year]. [Include any additional information about the creators or contributors].

## Dataset Description

### Source
- **Collection**: [Name of collection or source]
- **Time Period**: [e.g., "1880-1920"]
- **Language**: [e.g., "German", "English", "Mixed"]
- **Format**: [e.g., "Typewritten", "Handwritten", "Printed", "Mixed"]
- **Link**: [If available, link to the original dataset]
- **License**: [License information for the dataset]

### Contents
The dataset contains [number] images of [describe what the images contain]. Each image [describe relevant characteristics, e.g., "contains a single page from a historical newspaper", "consists of multiple pages of correspondence", etc.].

## Ground Truth

Models should output [describe the expected output format, e.g., "a JSON structure with the following fields...", "a list of extracted entities categorized by type", etc.].

```json
{
  "field1": "value",
  "field2": ["value1", "value2"],
  "field3": {
    "subfield1": "value",
    "subfield2": "value"
  }
}
```

## Scoring
The models are tasked with [clearly describe what the models are expected to do, e.g., "extracting named entities", "categorizing text segments", "transcribing handwritten text", etc.].

## Evaluation Criteria
Responses are evaluated based on:

- **[Criterion 1]**: [Explain how this criterion is evaluated]
- **[Criterion 2]**: [Explain how this criterion is evaluated]
- **[Criterion 3]**: [Explain how this criterion is evaluated]

### Scoring Methodology
The scoring methodology works as follows:

1. [Explain step 1 of the scoring process]
2. [Explain step 2 of the scoring process]
3. [Explain step 3 of the scoring process]

The final score is calculated by [explain how the final score is calculated, e.g., "taking the average of scores across all images", "computing a weighted average where criterion X has weight Y", etc.].

### Example Scoring
To illustrate the scoring methodology, here's an example of scoring for one document:

| Metric | Ground Truth | Prediction | Score |
|--------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Metric 1 | Value | Value | 0.95 |
| Metric 2 | Value | Value | 0.75 |
| Metric 3 | Value | Value | 0.80 |
| **Overall** | | | **0.83** |
