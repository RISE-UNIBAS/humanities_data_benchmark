    "response_text": "Let me help structure the entries from this bibliography page. The page shows entries from 1946 and appears to be page {page_number}.\n\nFrom the images, I'll structure key entries with special attention to the reviews and relations:\n\n{\n  \"entries\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 34,\n      \"author\": \"Baeck, Leo\",\n      \"title\": \"Der Sinn der Geschichte\",\n      \"publisher\": \"Habel\",\n      \"location\": \"Berlin\",\n      \"year\": 1946,\n      \"type\": \"book\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 35,\n      \"author\": \"Bryant, Arthur\",\n      \"title\": \"The Art of Writing History\",\n      \"publisher\": \"Oxford University Press\",\n      \"location\": \"Oxford\",\n      \"year\": 1946,\n      \"type\": \"book\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 36,\n      \"author\": \"Ca\u00f1al Barrachina, Avelino\",\n      \"title\": \"Historia y destino\",\n      \"publisher\": \"Ucar, Garcia\",\n      \"location\": \"Havana\",\n      \"year\": 1946,\n      \"type\": \"book\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 37,\n      \"author\": \"Collingwood, R.

The remaining entries (39-48) are all reviews or articles discussing Collingwood's work, particularly his \"The Idea of History\". Each would have a \"relation\": \"37\" as they review or discuss that work. Would you like me to continue with those entries as well?",
