The date appears to be \"Basel, 16 Sept 82\" (which would be 1882 based on the historical context)\n3. The letter begins with \"Herrn Dr. Hag Bütz\" followed by an address\n4. The letter is signed at the bottom with what appears to be \"W.M.\" (likely W. Meili-Wetti)\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"letter_title\": [\"null\"],\n    \"send_date\": [\"1882-09-16\"],\n    \"sender_persons\": [\"Dr. W.
