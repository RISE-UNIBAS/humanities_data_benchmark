    "response_text": "Looking at these two pages of a German letter, I can extract the following information:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"letter_title\": [\"null\"],\n    \"send_date\": [\"1923-04-04\"],\n    \"sender_persons\": [\"null\"],\n    \"receiver_persons\": [\"null\"]\n}\n```\n\nThe letter is dated \"Basel, den 4. April 1923\" (Basel, April 4, 1923) as shown at the top of the first page. The document appears to be addressed to \"Basler Rheinschiffahrt-Aktiengesellschaft BASEL\" (Basel Rhine Shipping Corporation), but this seems to be the subject organization being discussed rather than the recipient. The letter ends with \"BASLER PERSONENSCHIFFAHRTSGESELLSCHAFT\" which appears to be a signature block, but no individual person's name is provided. The letter has no formal title.",
