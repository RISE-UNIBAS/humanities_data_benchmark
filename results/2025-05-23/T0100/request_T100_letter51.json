    "text": "Looking at this historical German letter, I can identify the following information:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"letter_title\": [\"null\"],\n    \"send_date\": [\"1938-09-26\"],\n    \"sender_persons\": [\"null\"],\n    \"receiver_persons\": [\"null\"]\n}\n```\n\nThe letter is dated \"Basel, den 26.September 1938\" at the top. The letter appears to be addressed to \"Basler Rheinschiffahrts Aktiengesellschaft Direktion BASEL\" and mentions \"Marktgasse 5\" as an address. However, since this appears to be the recipient organization rather than a specific person's name, and the instructions ask for person names specifically, I've marked receiver_persons as null. The letter ends with \"In Hochachtung\" (With respect) but no sender name is visible in the image.",
