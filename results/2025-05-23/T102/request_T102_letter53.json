Oktober 1932\" (Basel, October 7, 1932). While it begins with \"Sehr geehrte Herren\" (Dear Sirs), this is a generic salutation that doesn't identify specific recipients. The letter appears to be from the \"Basler Personenschiffahrts-Gesellschaft\" (Basel Passenger Shipping Company) based on the letterhead, but no individual sender is named. There is no explicit title for the letter itself.",
