Aug. 1923\" (Basel, August 15, 1923). While I can see this is addressed to \"An die Basler Rheinschiffahrts A.-G.\" (To the Basel Rhine Shipping Company) and contains a salutation \"Sehr geehrte Herren,\" (Dear Sirs), the letter doesn't contain:\n- A specific title\n- The name of the individual sender (only shows \"BASLER FERSCHENFAHRTSGESELLSCHAFT\" as the organization letterhead)\n- Specific named recipients (only the general address to the company)\n\nThere appears to be a signature at the bottom, but it's not clearly legible enough to determine the specific name of the sender.",
