Juli 1926\" (July 13, 1926) at the top right. While I can see it references \"ALBATROS\" and appears to be official correspondence from some kind of business or organization (possibly \"Basler Personenschiffahrtsgesellschaft\" based on the letterhead at bottom), there are no clearly identified individual sender or receiver names, and no formal title for the letter itself.",
