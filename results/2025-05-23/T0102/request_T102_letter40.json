The sender's name is not clearly visible in the document - there appears to be a signature at the bottom of the second page but it's not legible enough to determine the sender's identity. The letter does not have a visible title, and while there appears to be a date reference (mentioning \"vom 24.ds.\" and \"vom 15. Mai\"), the complete date in YYYY-MM-DD format cannot be determined from the visible text.",
