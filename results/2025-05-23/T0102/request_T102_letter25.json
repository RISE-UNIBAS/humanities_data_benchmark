    "response_text": "Looking at these two pages of a historical German letter, I can extract the following information:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"letter_title\": [\"null\"],\n    \"send_date\": [\"1928-04-04\"],\n    \"sender_persons\": [\"null\"],\n    \"receiver_persons\": [\"null\"]\n}\n```\n\nThe letter is dated \"Basel, den 4. April 1928\" (Basel, April 4, 1928) which appears at the top of the first page. The document appears to be from Basler Rheinschiffahrt-Aktiengesellschaft (a shipping company) but doesn't clearly identify specific sender or receiver persons by name. The greeting \"Betrifft Kauf 'Rheinfelden' Ihr Schreiben vom 4. April\" suggests it's a business correspondence regarding the purchase of something called \"Rheinfelden\", but no formal title is given to the letter itself.",
