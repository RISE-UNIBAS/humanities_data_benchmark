The user wants me to extract information from a personnel card table and return it as a structured JSON object following specific rules. First, I need to understand the structure of the input. The image provided shows an empty table with column headers, but there's no data filled in.\\n\\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the user says \\\"the card contains rows documenting employment history...\\\" but the image shows an empty table. Hmm, maybe the actual data isn't present here. Wait, the user provided a schema and rules, but the image might be a placeholder. Wait, the example given in the problem statement is a table with headers like \\\"Dienstliche Stellung\\\", \\\"Dienstort\\\", etc., but all the cells are empty. So perhaps the task is to process an empty table.\\n\\nWait, the user says: \\\"Extract all information from this personnel card table and return it as a structured JSON object.\\\" But the image shows an empty table. So there's no data to extract. However, the instructions state that we must include ALL rows that have ANY content in ANY column. Since all cells are empty, there are no rows with content. Therefore, the rows array should be empty.\\n\\nWait, but the problem statement says: \\\"Empty rows (all cells empty) should be omitted.\\\" So if all cells in a row are empty, it's excluded. Since the table shown has all empty cells, there are no rows to include. So the JSON should have an empty rows array.\\n\\nBut let me double-check the rules. The user says: \\\"Include ALL rows that have ANY content in ANY column. Empty rows (all cells empty) should be omitted.\\\" So if a row has at least one non-empty cell, include it. But in this case, all cells are empty, so no rows are included.\\n\\nWait, but the problem statement also says: \\\"A row with only one filled cell should still be included.\\\" But in the provided image, all cells are empty, so no rows. Therefore, the output JSON should have an empty rows array.\\n\\nHowever, the user provided an example where the structure is required, but maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the image is a template, and the actual data is supposed to be present, but in the problem statement, the user provided an empty table. Maybe the user expects me to recognize that there's no data, so the rows array is empty.\\n\\nLet me check the JSON schema they provided. The required field is \\\"rows\\\", which is an array of TableRow objects. If there are no rows, then \\\"rows\\\" is an empty array. So the correct output would be {\\\"rows\\\": []}.\\n\\nWait, but the user's example shows a structure with a row_number starting at 1. But if there are no rows, then it's empty. Let me check the example they provided. The example shows:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"rows\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"row_number\\\": 1,\\n      ...\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nBut if there's no data, then it's an empty array.\\n\\nWait, but the user's instructions say: \\\"Include ALL rows that have ANY content in ANY column. Empty rows (all cells empty) should be omitted.\\\"\\n\\nSo since the table has no data, there are no rows to include. Therefore, the correct output is a JSON object with an empty rows array.\\n\\nBut let's confirm. The image shows a table with columns, but all cells are blank. So no entries. Therefore, no rows with any content, so rows array is empty.\\n\\nBut wait, the user might have made a mistake in providing an empty image. Wait, the user provided the image as a description of the table, which is empty. So according to the problem statement, the answer should be an empty rows array.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct JSON is {\\\"rows\\\": []}.\\n\\nWait, but the problem says: \\\"Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanation.\\\"\\n\\nSo I need to output exactly that. But let me check the schema again. The schema requires that each row has all the specified fields. However, if there are no rows, then the rows array is empty. The schema allows for that.\\n\\nSo the final JSON should be a JSON object with an empty array under \\\"rows\\\".\\n\",\"reasoning_details\":[{\"format\":\"unknown\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"reasoning.text\",\"text\":\"Okay, let me tackle this problem.
