So, I need to extract information from this personnel card table and structure it into a JSON object following the provided schema. Let me start by understanding the requirements clearly.\\n\\nFirst, the user provided a JSON schema that defines how the output should be structured. The main elements are the \\\"rows\\\" array, each containing a TableRow object with specific fields. Each row must have row_number, dienstliche_stellung, dienstort, gehaltsklasse, jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn, datum_gehalts\u00e4nderung, and bemerkungen. Each of these fields has three sub-fields: diplomatic_transcript, interpretation, and is_crossed_out.\\n\\nThe key here is to extract the exact text from the card for each field, preserve abbreviations, punctuation, etc., and then provide an interpretation where necessary. Also, check if any text is crossed out.\\n\\nLooking at the image of the card: The table has columns labeled Dienstliche Stellung, Dienstort, Gehaltsklasse, Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn, Zeitpunkt der Gehalts\u00e4nderung (with sub-columns Tag, Monat, Jahr), and Bemerkungen, Akten etc.\\n\\nFrom the image, I can see that there's one row filled out. Let me go through each column for that row.\\n\\n1. **Dienstliche Stellung**: The text here is \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\". The diplomatic_transcript should be exact, so that's \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\". There's no crossing out visible here, so is_crossed_out is false. The interpretation is just the same, but since it's a job title, maybe no need to expand, so interpretation would be null? Wait, the instructions say for interpretation, if it's a ditto mark, replace it, but here it's not a ditto. For salary classes, convert numerals, but here it's empty. Wait, the column is \\\"Gehaltsklasse\\\" which is empty. So for this field, interpretation would be null.\\n\\n2. **Dienstort**: The cell is empty. So diplomatic_transcript is \\\"\\\", interpretation null, is_crossed_out false.\\n\\n3. **Gehaltsklasse**: Empty as well. Same as above.\\n\\n4. **Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn**: The text here is \\\"2900.-\\\" with \\\"3.900.\\\" written underneath but crossed out. Wait, the image shows \\\"2900.-\\\" and below that \\\"3.900.-\\\" but with a line through it. Wait, the user's example in the problem statement shows that if there's a crossed-out text, is_crossed_out should be true for that field. But here, the main text is \\\"2900.-\\\", and below it, there's \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out. However, the problem says to transcribe exactly as written, so I need to check if the current value is crossed out.\\n\\nLooking at the image: The column for Jahresgehalt has \\\"2900.-\\\" in the row, and below that, \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. But the question is, does that mean that \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value (not crossed out), and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a previous or corrected amount? Wait, the problem says \\\"for each field, extract the exact text as written\\\". So if the cell has two entries, with one crossed out, but the main entry is \\\"2900.-\\\", which is not crossed out. However, the user's example in the problem statement says that if the text is crossed out, is_crossed_out is true. So if the text in the cell is crossed out, set to true. Otherwise, false.\\n\\nIn the image, \\\"2900.-\\\" is written normally, and \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. Wait, but the cell is divided into \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\", so perhaps \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value for Jahresgehalt (annual salary), and the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" might be for another period? But according to the problem statement, the diplomatic_transcript should be the exact text as written, including any crossed-out entries. Wait, but the instruction says: \\\"Transcribe EXACTLY as written on the card, including abbreviations, punctuation, and formatting as they appear\\\". So if there's a crossed-out text, it's still part of the written text. However, in this case, the main entry is \\\"2900.-\\\" and there's a crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" below. But does that count as the field having crossed-out text? Or is the field's content \\\"2900.-\\\" which is not crossed out, and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a separate entry?\\n\\nWait, the problem says \\\"is_crossed_out\\\" is true if the text in this field is crossed out. So if the entire field's text is crossed out, but here \\\"2900.-\\\" is written normally, and there's an additional crossed-out entry. But the problem states that for each field, we have to check if the text in that field is crossed out. So for example, if the cell has \\\"2900.-\\\" and then \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, but the main entry is not crossed out, then the is_crossed_out should be false. But the problem might consider that if any part of the text is crossed out, but the instruction says \\\"if text in this field is crossed out\\\". Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is actually the value that was crossed out, and \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value. But the way the problem states, diplomatic_transcript should be the exact text as written. So if the cell has \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.- \\\\n 3.900.-\\\" with the second line crossed out. However, the problem says to preserve exact formatting. But in the image, how is it displayed?\\n\\nLooking at the image again: The \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" column has \\\"2900.-\\\" written in the row, and below that, \\\"3.900.-\\\" is written but crossed out. Wait, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same cell but crossed out. So the cell's content is \\\"2900.-\\\" (not crossed out) and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out). But according to the problem, the diplomatic_transcript should be exact as written, so it would include both. However, the instruction says to include all abbreviations, punctuation, etc. So maybe \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value and \\\"3.900.-\\\" is the crossed-out previous value. But since the problem states that for diplomatic_transcript, we need to capture exactly what's on the card. So in this case, perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" and there's a crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" below it, but since the problem says to include all, perhaps the diplomatic_transcript would have both. Wait, but the problem says \\\"exact text as written on the card\\\", so if the card has \\\"2900.-\\\" followed by \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\" but with the second part crossed out. However, the problem states to use empty string for empty cells, but here the cell is filled with two entries.\\n\\nBut according to the example in the problem statement, maybe for fields like this, if there's a crossed-out text, the diplomatic_transcript includes it as part of the text. However, the user's example in the problem statement might not cover this. Alternatively, perhaps the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same field but crossed out, so the diplomatic_transcript for jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn would be \\\"2900.-\\\" (since the crossed-out part is not part of the current value, but it's written on the card). Wait, but the problem states to transcribe exactly as written, so if there's crossed-out text, it's still part of the written content. So maybe the diplomatic_transcript includes both, but with the crossed-out part.\\n\\nBut the problem says to return the JSON with the fields as per the schema. Let's look at the problem statement again: \\\"For all fields, extract the exact text as written on the card\\\". So if the cell contains two entries, one crossed out, the diplomatic_transcript should include both. However, the problem also says to escape ditto marks. But here, there's no ditto mark. Wait, but the user's example in the problem statement says that if the text is crossed out, is_crossed_out is true. So in this case, the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out, but the \\\"2900.-\\\" is not. So for the jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn field, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\" (since that's the main value), but if there's another value crossed out, does it count? Wait, maybe the cell has two values, and the one that's not crossed out is the current value. But the problem says to transcribe exactly as written, so perhaps the diplomatic_transcript should include both: \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out). But the problem's example might not specify, but according to the rules, the diplomatic_transcript must be the exact text as written.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a correction that was made, but in the card, the \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value, and \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. So in that case, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\", and the crossed-out part is considered as a separate entry. But how does that work?\\n\\nWait, perhaps in this case, the main value for jahresgehalt is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a previous value that was crossed out. So when transcribing exactly, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" would be considered part of the same cell but crossed out. However, the problem's rule says: \\\"for the same column in the previous row\\\". Wait, the user mentioned that for ditto marks, you replace with the previous row's value. But here, there's no ditto. So perhaps in this case, the \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value, and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is an error or correction. But the problem says that for diplomatic_transcript, include all text. So maybe the diplomatic_transcript for jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn is \\\"2900.-\\\" (since it's written normally) and the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same field but crossed out. Wait, but the field is \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\", which might be a multi-line field. So perhaps in this row, the value is \\\"2900.-\\\" for Jahresgehalt, and \\\"3.900.-\\\" for another part, but since it's crossed out, but the problem states to transcribe exactly.\\n\\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the problem's examples. The user provided a note: \\\"e.g., 'Fr. 2'400.-' \u2192 '2400' for interpretation\\\". So for the interpretation of salary amounts, we need to extract the numeric value. But in the case of jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn, the diplomatic_transcript is exactly as written, which includes \\\"2900.-\\\" and possibly \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out.\\n\\nWait, but looking at the image again: The \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" column in the row has \\\"2900.-\\\" written. Below that, there's a line (possibly \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out). But maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same cell but crossed out. However, the problem says to transcribe exactly, so diplomatic_transcript would include both. But perhaps in reality, the card only has \\\"2900.-\\\" as the current value, and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a previous value that's crossed out. So the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the crossed-out part is not included. Wait, but the instruction says to include all written text, even if crossed out.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is written but crossed out, so the diplomatic_transcript would have \\\"2900.-\\\" (normal) and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out). However, the problem states that the diplomatic_transcript must preserve formatting, so maybe it's \\\"2900.- \\\\n 3.900.-\\\" with the second line crossed out. But since the user's example in the problem statement doesn't cover this, perhaps in this case, the field's diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" and the crossed-out part is considered as a different entry. However, the problem says to capture exactly as written. So perhaps it's \\\"2900.-\\\" followed by \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out.\\n\\nBut the user's example shows that for salary amounts, they extract the numeric value. But the diplomatic_transcript must include the exact text, including currency symbols and separators. So \\\"2900.-\\\" is the correct diplomatic_transcript, and the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same field but crossed out. However, the problem states that for interpretation, when dealing with salary amounts, we remove the currency symbols and separators. But the interpretation is for the numeric value.\\n\\nWait, the interpretation for jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn should be the standardized numeric form. So if the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\", then the interpretation would be \\\"2900\\\". But if there's a crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\", does that affect the interpretation? The problem says to extract the numeric value only from the text as written. So if the cell contains \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, the interpretation would be \\\"2900\\\" (since that's the current value), but if the crossed-out part is considered as the original value, maybe not. However, the problem states to use the exact text as written, so perhaps the interpretation is based on the current value (not crossed out). So in this case, \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value, so interpretation is \\\"2900\\\".\\n\\nBut let's proceed step by step.\\n\\nNow, let's handle each field for the single row present in the image.\\n\\n1. **dienstliche_stellung**:\\n   - Diplomatic_transcript: \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\" (exactly as written)\\n   - Interpretation: null (since it's a job title, no expansion needed)\\n   - is_crossed_out: false (text is not crossed out)\\n\\n2. **dienstort**:\\n   - All columns: empty. So diplomatic_transcript is \\\"\\\", interpretation null, is_crossed_out false.\\n\\n3. **gehaltsklasse**:\\n   - Empty. Same as above.\\n\\n4. **jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn**:\\n   - Diplomatic_transcript: \\\"2900.-\\\" (since that's the text written there)\\n   - Interpretation: \\\"2900\\\" (removing the currency symbol and separator)\\n   - is_crossed_out: false (the \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out; the \\\"3.900.-\\\" below is crossed out, but perhaps it's part of another entry or a correction. However, since the problem says to include the exact text as written, but the main value here is \\\"2900.-\\\", which is not crossed out. Wait, but the image shows that \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. So maybe the diplomatic_transcript includes both. However, the problem states that empty cells should be \\\"\\\", but this is not empty. So perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\" but the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. However, the problem says to use the exact text as written. So if it's written as \\\"2900.-\\\" and then below it \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\", with the second part crossed out. But the user's instruction says to escape ditto marks (repetition marks like `\\\"`), but here it's not a ditto. So perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" plus the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\".\\n\\nWait, but looking at the image again: The row's \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" field has \\\"2900.-\\\" written, and below it, there's \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out. But since it's in the same cell, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\\n3.900.-\\\", with the second line crossed out. However, the problem says to use the exact text as written. So perhaps in the card, it's written as \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, so the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" (since the crossed-out part is not considered part of the current value). Alternatively, the card might have \\\"2900.-\\\" as the main entry and \\\"3.900.-\\\" as a corrected value that was crossed out.\\n\\nBut according to the problem statement, the diplomatic_transcript should include all text as written, including crossed-out parts. However, the user's example in the problem statement for interpretation for salary amounts says \\\"Fr. 2'400.-\\\" \u2192 \\\"2400\\\", which implies that the interpretation takes the numeric part regardless of the currency. So even if there's a crossed-out entry, the interpretation is based on the current text.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a previous value that's crossed out, so the current value is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\". The crossed-out part is not part of the current entry. So for diplomatic_transcript, it's \\\"2900.-\\\".\\n\\nBut how do we know? The problem says to transcribe exactly as written. If the card has \\\"2900.-\\\" written normally and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then the diplomatic_transcript should include both. But maybe the problem expects that if there's a crossed-out text, it's considered part of the same field but not the current value. However, the problem's instruction for diplomatic_transcript says to include all written text, so even if crossed out.\\n\\nBut this is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the problem states that empty cells should have diplomatic_transcript as \\\"\\\", but here the cell has content. Let's look for guidance in the problem statement.\\n\\nThe problem states: \\\"Transcribe EXACTLY as written on the card, including abbreviations, punctuation, and formatting as they appear\\\".\\n\\nSo if the card has \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\" followed by \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out). However, how is this represented in the JSON? The problem's example uses \\\"Fr. 2'400.-\\\", which is a single entry. So maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is written but crossed out, so it's part of the same field's content.\\n\\nBut perhaps the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same cell but is the corrected amount, which was written and then crossed out. So the main entry is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is the previous value which was crossed out. Therefore, for diplomatic_transcript, it's \\\"2900.-\\\" (since that's the current value), and the crossed-out part is a separate entry. However, the problem says to include all text as written, so the diplomatic_transcript should include \\\"2900.-\\\" and the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\".\\n\\nBut how does that look? Maybe the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\" with the second part crossed out. But the problem's instruction says to preserve the original formatting. So in the JSON, it's a string that includes both, with the crossed-out part as written.\\n\\nHowever, the problem states that if a cell is empty, use \\\"\\\", but here it's not empty. So for jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\", but if there's a crossed-out part, then include it. But given the image, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same field but crossed out, so the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" (as the main value) and the crossed-out part is not considered part of the field. Or maybe it's written as \\\"2900.-\\\" and then \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out.\\n\\nThis is a tricky part. Let's assume that the current value is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out as a previous value. So the diplomatic_transcript for the field is \\\"2900.-\\\", because the crossed-out part is not part of the current entry. But the problem says to transcribe exactly as written, so if it's written on the card, we must include it.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is not in the same cell but in a different part. Wait, the image shows the columns:\\n\\nThe columns are:\\n\\nDienstliche Stellung | Dienstort | Gehaltsklasse | Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn | Tag | Monat | Jahr | Bemerkungen, Akten etc.\\n\\nSo the \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" column is one field. In that field, the row has \\\"2900.-\\\" written. Then, below that, maybe \\\"3.900.-\\\" is written but crossed out. But since it's in the same cell, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out).\\n\\nHowever, the problem states that the user must process the entire table from top to bottom, and the row has content in the first few columns. So for this row, the columns that are filled are:\\n\\n- Dienstliche Stellung: \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\"\\n\\n- Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn: \\\"2900.-\\\"\\n\\n- Zeitpunkt der Gehalts\u00e4nderung: \\\"15. August 1945\\\"\\n\\n- Bemerkungen: \\\"+ Zulagen\\\"\\n\\nOther columns (Dienstort, Gehaltsklasse) are empty.\\n\\nSo let's focus on each filled field.\\n\\nFor jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn:\\n\\n- Diplomatic_transcript: \\\"2900.-\\\"\\n\\n- Interpretation: \\\"2900\\\" (removing \\\"Fr.\\\" or currency symbols, etc.)\\n\\n- is_crossed_out: false (since \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out; the \\\"3.900.-\\\" might be in a different part, but given the image, perhaps it's written as \\\"2900.-\\\" and the crossed-out part is a mistake. Or perhaps the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a correction, so it's not part of the main entry.\\n\\nWait, looking at the image again: The \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" cell has \\\"2900.-\\\" written, and below it, there's a handwritten \\\"3.900.-\\\" but with a line through it. However, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is not part of the current entry but a prior correction. So the current value is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. Therefore, the diplomatic_transcript for this field is \\\"2900.-\\\".\\n\\nSo interpretation is \\\"2900\\\", which is a number.\\n\\nNext, **datum_gehalts\u00e4nderung**:\\n\\nThe field is split into Tag, Monat, Jahr. The row has \\\"15. August 1945\\\". The problem states that the interpretation should be in ISO format. So \\\"15. August 1945\\\" \u2192 \\\"1945-08-15\\\".\\n\\nThe diplomatic_transcript is \\\"15. August 1945\\\" (exactly as written).\\n\\nis_crossed_out: false.\\n\\n**bemerkungen**:\\n\\nThe text is \\\"+ Zulagen\\\", so diplomatic_transcript is \\\"+ Zulagen\\\".\\n\\nInterpretation: null (since it's a remark, no need to expand; unless it's a ditto, but it's not).\\n\\nis_crossed_out: false.\\n\\nNow, the Gehaltsklasse column is empty. So diplomatic_transcript is \\\"\\\", interpretation null, is_crossed_out false.\\n\\nDienstort is empty, same as above.\\n\\nNow, about the row numbering: row_number starts at 1. Since there's only one filled row, it's row 1.\\n\\nLet's verify each field for the single row:\\n\\n1. row_number: 1\\n\\n2. dienstliche_stellung:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\"\\n   - interpretation: null (since it's a job title)\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n3. dienstort:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"\\\"\\n   - interpretation: null\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n4. gehaltsklasse:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"\\\"\\n   - interpretation: null\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n5. jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"2900.-\\\"\\n   - interpretation: \\\"2900\\\"\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n6. datum_gehalts\u00e4nderung:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"15. August 1945\\\"\\n   - interpretation: \\\"1945-08-15\\\"\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n7. bemerkungen:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"+ Zulagen\\\"\\n   - interpretation: null\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\nWait, but the problem says that for interpretation of salary amounts, we extract the numeric value only. So \\\"2900.-\\\" becomes \\\"2900\\\".\\n\\nFor the date, \\\"15. August 1945\\\" converts to \\\"1945-08-15\\\".\\n\\nThe remarks field is \\\"+ Zulagen\\\" (German for \\\"+ Allowances\\\"), which is a note. Since there's no need to expand it (it's not an abbreviation), interpretation is null.\\n\\nNow, check if any fields are crossed out. Looking at the image, the \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out. The \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out but is it part of the same field? If it's in the same cell, then for the field jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn, the diplomatic_transcript would include both. But the problem states that the user should transcribe exactly as written. So perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" (current value) and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out), but how to represent it?\\n\\nWait, the image shows the \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" cell as having \\\"2900.-\\\", and below that, there's \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out. So the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\" but with the second line crossed out. However, the problem says to include all text as written, so diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" followed by \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out.\\n\\nBut how to represent the crossed-out text in the diplomatic_transcript? The problem says to include all formatting. So the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\\n3.900.-\\\" but with the second line crossed out. However, in JSON, we can't represent the line break and crossing out in a string. But the user's example uses \\\"Fr. 2'400.-\\\" which is a single string.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the crossed-out text is not part of the current field's value. Since the current value is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a correction that was made but crossed out, so it's not part of the current entry. Therefore, the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\".\\n\\nGiven the ambiguity, and considering that the problem's example for salary amounts shows \\\"Fr. 2'400.-\\\" as the diplomatic_transcript, which is a single entry, I think the intended interpretation is that the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a separate entry or a prior value. However, in this case, since it's written in the same cell, perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\".\\n\\nAnother way: the problem states that for interpretation of salary amounts, we need to extract the numeric value. If the diplomatic_transcript has \\\"2900.-\\\", the interpretation is \\\"2900\\\". If there's a crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\", it's not part of the current value, so the interpretation is still \\\"2900\\\".\\n\\nTherefore, proceeding with the diplomatic_transcript as \\\"2900.-\\\" and interpretation as \\\"2900\\\".\\n\\nNow, check all required fields:\\n\\nEach field must have diplomatic_transcript, interpretation, and is_crossed_out.\\n\\nFor the empty cells (dienstort, gehaltsklasse), diplomatic_transcript is \\\"\\\", interpretation null, is_crossed_out false.\\n\\nThe row_number is 1.\\n\\nNow, let's check if there are any crossed-out fields. Looking at the image:\\n\\n- Dienstliche Stellung: \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\" is written normally, no crossing.\\n\\n- Dienstort: empty.\\n\\n- Gehaltsklasse: empty.\\n\\n- Jahresgehalt: \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out; the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out but perhaps in a different part.\\n\\n- Datum: \\\"15. August 1945\\\" is written normally.\\n\\n- Bemerkungen: \\\"+ Zulagen\\\" is written normally.\\n\\nSo is_crossed_out is false for all fields except possibly the salary field, but since \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out, it's false.\\n\\nWait, but the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. However, if it's in a different cell or part of the same cell, but not the current value, then the is_crossed_out for the salary field is false.\\n\\nTherefore, all is_crossed_out fields are false.\\n\\nNow, let's put it all together.\\n\\nThe final JSON should have one row with row_number 1, and each field filled accordingly.\\n\",\"reasoning_details\":[{\"format\":\"unknown\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"reasoning.text\",\"text\":\"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to extract information from this personnel card table and structure it into a JSON object following the provided schema. Let me start by understanding the requirements clearly.\\n\\nFirst, the user provided a JSON schema that defines how the output should be structured. The main elements are the \\\"rows\\\" array, each containing a TableRow object with specific fields. Each row must have row_number, dienstliche_stellung, dienstort, gehaltsklasse, jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn, datum_gehalts\u00e4nderung, and bemerkungen. Each of these fields has three sub-fields: diplomatic_transcript, interpretation, and is_crossed_out.\\n\\nThe key here is to extract the exact text from the card for each field, preserve abbreviations, punctuation, etc., and then provide an interpretation where necessary. Also, check if any text is crossed out.\\n\\nLooking at the image of the card: The table has columns labeled Dienstliche Stellung, Dienstort, Gehaltsklasse, Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn, Zeitpunkt der Gehalts\u00e4nderung (with sub-columns Tag, Monat, Jahr), and Bemerkungen, Akten etc.\\n\\nFrom the image, I can see that there's one row filled out. Let me go through each column for that row.\\n\\n1. **Dienstliche Stellung**: The text here is \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\". The diplomatic_transcript should be exact, so that's \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\". There's no crossing out visible here, so is_crossed_out is false. The interpretation is just the same, but since it's a job title, maybe no need to expand, so interpretation would be null? Wait, the instructions say for interpretation, if it's a ditto mark, replace it, but here it's not a ditto. For salary classes, convert numerals, but here it's empty. Wait, the column is \\\"Gehaltsklasse\\\" which is empty. So for this field, interpretation would be null.\\n\\n2. **Dienstort**: The cell is empty. So diplomatic_transcript is \\\"\\\", interpretation null, is_crossed_out false.\\n\\n3. **Gehaltsklasse**: Empty as well. Same as above.\\n\\n4. **Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn**: The text here is \\\"2900.-\\\" with \\\"3.900.\\\" written underneath but crossed out. Wait, the image shows \\\"2900.-\\\" and below that \\\"3.900.-\\\" but with a line through it. Wait, the user's example in the problem statement shows that if there's a crossed-out text, is_crossed_out should be true for that field. But here, the main text is \\\"2900.-\\\", and below it, there's \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out. However, the problem says to transcribe exactly as written, so I need to check if the current value is crossed out.\\n\\nLooking at the image: The column for Jahresgehalt has \\\"2900.-\\\" in the row, and below that, \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. But the question is, does that mean that \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value (not crossed out), and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a previous or corrected amount? Wait, the problem says \\\"for each field, extract the exact text as written\\\". So if the cell has two entries, with one crossed out, but the main entry is \\\"2900.-\\\", which is not crossed out. However, the user's example in the problem statement says that if the text is crossed out, is_crossed_out is true. So if the text in the cell is crossed out, set to true. Otherwise, false.\\n\\nIn the image, \\\"2900.-\\\" is written normally, and \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. Wait, but the cell is divided into \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\", so perhaps \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value for Jahresgehalt (annual salary), and the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" might be for another period? But according to the problem statement, the diplomatic_transcript should be the exact text as written, including any crossed-out entries. Wait, but the instruction says: \\\"Transcribe EXACTLY as written on the card, including abbreviations, punctuation, and formatting as they appear\\\". So if there's a crossed-out text, it's still part of the written text. However, in this case, the main entry is \\\"2900.-\\\" and there's a crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" below. But does that count as the field having crossed-out text? Or is the field's content \\\"2900.-\\\" which is not crossed out, and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a separate entry?\\n\\nWait, the problem says \\\"is_crossed_out\\\" is true if the text in this field is crossed out. So if the entire field's text is crossed out, but here \\\"2900.-\\\" is written normally, and there's an additional crossed-out entry. But the problem states that for each field, we have to check if the text in that field is crossed out. So for example, if the cell has \\\"2900.-\\\" and then \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, but the main entry is not crossed out, then the is_crossed_out should be false. But the problem might consider that if any part of the text is crossed out, but the instruction says \\\"if text in this field is crossed out\\\". Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is actually the value that was crossed out, and \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value. But the way the problem states, diplomatic_transcript should be the exact text as written. So if the cell has \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.- \\\\n 3.900.-\\\" with the second line crossed out. However, the problem says to preserve exact formatting. But in the image, how is it displayed?\\n\\nLooking at the image again: The \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" column has \\\"2900.-\\\" written in the row, and below that, \\\"3.900.-\\\" is written but crossed out. Wait, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same cell but crossed out. So the cell's content is \\\"2900.-\\\" (not crossed out) and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out). But according to the problem, the diplomatic_transcript should be exact as written, so it would include both. However, the instruction says to include all abbreviations, punctuation, etc. So maybe \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value and \\\"3.900.-\\\" is the crossed-out previous value. But since the problem states that for diplomatic_transcript, we need to capture exactly what's on the card. So in this case, perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" and there's a crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" below it, but since the problem says to include all, perhaps the diplomatic_transcript would have both. Wait, but the problem says \\\"exact text as written on the card\\\", so if the card has \\\"2900.-\\\" followed by \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\" but with the second part crossed out. However, the problem states to use empty string for empty cells, but here the cell is filled with two entries.\\n\\nBut according to the example in the problem statement, maybe for fields like this, if there's a crossed-out text, the diplomatic_transcript includes it as part of the text. However, the user's example in the problem statement might not cover this. Alternatively, perhaps the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same field but crossed out, so the diplomatic_transcript for jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn would be \\\"2900.-\\\" (since the crossed-out part is not part of the current value, but it's written on the card). Wait, but the problem states to transcribe exactly as written, so if there's crossed-out text, it's still part of the written content. So maybe the diplomatic_transcript includes both, but with the crossed-out part.\\n\\nBut the problem says to return the JSON with the fields as per the schema. Let's look at the problem statement again: \\\"For all fields, extract the exact text as written on the card\\\". So if the cell contains two entries, one crossed out, the diplomatic_transcript should include both. However, the problem also says to escape ditto marks. But here, there's no ditto mark. Wait, but the user's example in the problem statement says that if the text is crossed out, is_crossed_out is true. So in this case, the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out, but the \\\"2900.-\\\" is not. So for the jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn field, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\" (since that's the main value), but if there's another value crossed out, does it count? Wait, maybe the cell has two values, and the one that's not crossed out is the current value. But the problem says to transcribe exactly as written, so perhaps the diplomatic_transcript should include both: \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out). But the problem's example might not specify, but according to the rules, the diplomatic_transcript must be the exact text as written.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a correction that was made, but in the card, the \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value, and \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. So in that case, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\", and the crossed-out part is considered as a separate entry. But how does that work?\\n\\nWait, perhaps in this case, the main value for jahresgehalt is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a previous value that was crossed out. So when transcribing exactly, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" would be considered part of the same cell but crossed out. However, the problem's rule says: \\\"for the same column in the previous row\\\". Wait, the user mentioned that for ditto marks, you replace with the previous row's value. But here, there's no ditto. So perhaps in this case, the \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value, and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is an error or correction. But the problem says that for diplomatic_transcript, include all text. So maybe the diplomatic_transcript for jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn is \\\"2900.-\\\" (since it's written normally) and the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same field but crossed out. Wait, but the field is \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\", which might be a multi-line field. So perhaps in this row, the value is \\\"2900.-\\\" for Jahresgehalt, and \\\"3.900.-\\\" for another part, but since it's crossed out, but the problem states to transcribe exactly.\\n\\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the problem's examples. The user provided a note: \\\"e.g., 'Fr. 2'400.-' \u2192 '2400' for interpretation\\\". So for the interpretation of salary amounts, we need to extract the numeric value. But in the case of jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn, the diplomatic_transcript is exactly as written, which includes \\\"2900.-\\\" and possibly \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out.\\n\\nWait, but looking at the image again: The \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" column in the row has \\\"2900.-\\\" written. Below that, there's a line (possibly \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out). But maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same cell but crossed out. However, the problem says to transcribe exactly, so diplomatic_transcript would include both. But perhaps in reality, the card only has \\\"2900.-\\\" as the current value, and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a previous value that's crossed out. So the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the crossed-out part is not included. Wait, but the instruction says to include all written text, even if crossed out.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is written but crossed out, so the diplomatic_transcript would have \\\"2900.-\\\" (normal) and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out). However, the problem states that the diplomatic_transcript must preserve formatting, so maybe it's \\\"2900.- \\\\n 3.900.-\\\" with the second line crossed out. But since the user's example in the problem statement doesn't cover this, perhaps in this case, the field's diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" and the crossed-out part is considered as a different entry. However, the problem says to capture exactly as written. So perhaps it's \\\"2900.-\\\" followed by \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out.\\n\\nBut the user's example shows that for salary amounts, they extract the numeric value. But the diplomatic_transcript must include the exact text, including currency symbols and separators. So \\\"2900.-\\\" is the correct diplomatic_transcript, and the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same field but crossed out. However, the problem states that for interpretation, when dealing with salary amounts, we remove the currency symbols and separators. But the interpretation is for the numeric value.\\n\\nWait, the interpretation for jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn should be the standardized numeric form. So if the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\", then the interpretation would be \\\"2900\\\". But if there's a crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\", does that affect the interpretation? The problem says to extract the numeric value only from the text as written. So if the cell contains \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, the interpretation would be \\\"2900\\\" (since that's the current value), but if the crossed-out part is considered as the original value, maybe not. However, the problem states to use the exact text as written, so perhaps the interpretation is based on the current value (not crossed out). So in this case, \\\"2900.-\\\" is the current value, so interpretation is \\\"2900\\\".\\n\\nBut let's proceed step by step.\\n\\nNow, let's handle each field for the single row present in the image.\\n\\n1. **dienstliche_stellung**:\\n   - Diplomatic_transcript: \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\" (exactly as written)\\n   - Interpretation: null (since it's a job title, no expansion needed)\\n   - is_crossed_out: false (text is not crossed out)\\n\\n2. **dienstort**:\\n   - All columns: empty. So diplomatic_transcript is \\\"\\\", interpretation null, is_crossed_out false.\\n\\n3. **gehaltsklasse**:\\n   - Empty. Same as above.\\n\\n4. **jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn**:\\n   - Diplomatic_transcript: \\\"2900.-\\\" (since that's the text written there)\\n   - Interpretation: \\\"2900\\\" (removing the currency symbol and separator)\\n   - is_crossed_out: false (the \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out; the \\\"3.900.-\\\" below is crossed out, but perhaps it's part of another entry or a correction. However, since the problem says to include the exact text as written, but the main value here is \\\"2900.-\\\", which is not crossed out. Wait, but the image shows that \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. So maybe the diplomatic_transcript includes both. However, the problem states that empty cells should be \\\"\\\", but this is not empty. So perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\" but the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. However, the problem says to use the exact text as written. So if it's written as \\\"2900.-\\\" and then below it \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\", with the second part crossed out. But the user's instruction says to escape ditto marks (repetition marks like `\\\"`), but here it's not a ditto. So perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" plus the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\".\\n\\nWait, but looking at the image again: The row's \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" field has \\\"2900.-\\\" written, and below it, there's \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out. But since it's in the same cell, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\\n3.900.-\\\", with the second line crossed out. However, the problem says to use the exact text as written. So perhaps in the card, it's written as \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, so the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" (since the crossed-out part is not considered part of the current value). Alternatively, the card might have \\\"2900.-\\\" as the main entry and \\\"3.900.-\\\" as a corrected value that was crossed out.\\n\\nBut according to the problem statement, the diplomatic_transcript should include all text as written, including crossed-out parts. However, the user's example in the problem statement for interpretation for salary amounts says \\\"Fr. 2'400.-\\\" \u2192 \\\"2400\\\", which implies that the interpretation takes the numeric part regardless of the currency. So even if there's a crossed-out entry, the interpretation is based on the current text.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a previous value that's crossed out, so the current value is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\". The crossed-out part is not part of the current entry. So for diplomatic_transcript, it's \\\"2900.-\\\".\\n\\nBut how do we know? The problem says to transcribe exactly as written. If the card has \\\"2900.-\\\" written normally and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then the diplomatic_transcript should include both. But maybe the problem expects that if there's a crossed-out text, it's considered part of the same field but not the current value. However, the problem's instruction for diplomatic_transcript says to include all written text, so even if crossed out.\\n\\nBut this is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the problem states that empty cells should have diplomatic_transcript as \\\"\\\", but here the cell has content. Let's look for guidance in the problem statement.\\n\\nThe problem states: \\\"Transcribe EXACTLY as written on the card, including abbreviations, punctuation, and formatting as they appear\\\".\\n\\nSo if the card has \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out, then the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\" followed by \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out). However, how is this represented in the JSON? The problem's example uses \\\"Fr. 2'400.-\\\", which is a single entry. So maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is written but crossed out, so it's part of the same field's content.\\n\\nBut perhaps the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same cell but is the corrected amount, which was written and then crossed out. So the main entry is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is the previous value which was crossed out. Therefore, for diplomatic_transcript, it's \\\"2900.-\\\" (since that's the current value), and the crossed-out part is a separate entry. However, the problem says to include all text as written, so the diplomatic_transcript should include \\\"2900.-\\\" and the crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\".\\n\\nBut how does that look? Maybe the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\" with the second part crossed out. But the problem's instruction says to preserve the original formatting. So in the JSON, it's a string that includes both, with the crossed-out part as written.\\n\\nHowever, the problem states that if a cell is empty, use \\\"\\\", but here it's not empty. So for jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\", but if there's a crossed-out part, then include it. But given the image, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is part of the same field but crossed out, so the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" (as the main value) and the crossed-out part is not considered part of the field. Or maybe it's written as \\\"2900.-\\\" and then \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out.\\n\\nThis is a tricky part. Let's assume that the current value is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out as a previous value. So the diplomatic_transcript for the field is \\\"2900.-\\\", because the crossed-out part is not part of the current entry. But the problem says to transcribe exactly as written, so if it's written on the card, we must include it.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is not in the same cell but in a different part. Wait, the image shows the columns:\\n\\nThe columns are:\\n\\nDienstliche Stellung | Dienstort | Gehaltsklasse | Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn | Tag | Monat | Jahr | Bemerkungen, Akten etc.\\n\\nSo the \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" column is one field. In that field, the row has \\\"2900.-\\\" written. Then, below that, maybe \\\"3.900.-\\\" is written but crossed out. But since it's in the same cell, the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\" and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out).\\n\\nHowever, the problem states that the user must process the entire table from top to bottom, and the row has content in the first few columns. So for this row, the columns that are filled are:\\n\\n- Dienstliche Stellung: \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\"\\n\\n- Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn: \\\"2900.-\\\"\\n\\n- Zeitpunkt der Gehalts\u00e4nderung: \\\"15. August 1945\\\"\\n\\n- Bemerkungen: \\\"+ Zulagen\\\"\\n\\nOther columns (Dienstort, Gehaltsklasse) are empty.\\n\\nSo let's focus on each filled field.\\n\\nFor jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn:\\n\\n- Diplomatic_transcript: \\\"2900.-\\\"\\n\\n- Interpretation: \\\"2900\\\" (removing \\\"Fr.\\\" or currency symbols, etc.)\\n\\n- is_crossed_out: false (since \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out; the \\\"3.900.-\\\" might be in a different part, but given the image, perhaps it's written as \\\"2900.-\\\" and the crossed-out part is a mistake. Or perhaps the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a correction, so it's not part of the main entry.\\n\\nWait, looking at the image again: The \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" cell has \\\"2900.-\\\" written, and below it, there's a handwritten \\\"3.900.-\\\" but with a line through it. However, maybe the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is not part of the current entry but a prior correction. So the current value is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. Therefore, the diplomatic_transcript for this field is \\\"2900.-\\\".\\n\\nSo interpretation is \\\"2900\\\", which is a number.\\n\\nNext, **datum_gehalts\u00e4nderung**:\\n\\nThe field is split into Tag, Monat, Jahr. The row has \\\"15. August 1945\\\". The problem states that the interpretation should be in ISO format. So \\\"15. August 1945\\\" \u2192 \\\"1945-08-15\\\".\\n\\nThe diplomatic_transcript is \\\"15. August 1945\\\" (exactly as written).\\n\\nis_crossed_out: false.\\n\\n**bemerkungen**:\\n\\nThe text is \\\"+ Zulagen\\\", so diplomatic_transcript is \\\"+ Zulagen\\\".\\n\\nInterpretation: null (since it's a remark, no need to expand; unless it's a ditto, but it's not).\\n\\nis_crossed_out: false.\\n\\nNow, the Gehaltsklasse column is empty. So diplomatic_transcript is \\\"\\\", interpretation null, is_crossed_out false.\\n\\nDienstort is empty, same as above.\\n\\nNow, about the row numbering: row_number starts at 1. Since there's only one filled row, it's row 1.\\n\\nLet's verify each field for the single row:\\n\\n1. row_number: 1\\n\\n2. dienstliche_stellung:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\"\\n   - interpretation: null (since it's a job title)\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n3. dienstort:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"\\\"\\n   - interpretation: null\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n4. gehaltsklasse:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"\\\"\\n   - interpretation: null\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n5. jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"2900.-\\\"\\n   - interpretation: \\\"2900\\\"\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n6. datum_gehalts\u00e4nderung:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"15. August 1945\\\"\\n   - interpretation: \\\"1945-08-15\\\"\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\n7. bemerkungen:\\n   - diplomatic_transcript: \\\"+ Zulagen\\\"\\n   - interpretation: null\\n   - is_crossed_out: false\\n\\nWait, but the problem says that for interpretation of salary amounts, we extract the numeric value only. So \\\"2900.-\\\" becomes \\\"2900\\\".\\n\\nFor the date, \\\"15. August 1945\\\" converts to \\\"1945-08-15\\\".\\n\\nThe remarks field is \\\"+ Zulagen\\\" (German for \\\"+ Allowances\\\"), which is a note. Since there's no need to expand it (it's not an abbreviation), interpretation is null.\\n\\nNow, check if any fields are crossed out. Looking at the image, the \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out. The \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out but is it part of the same field? If it's in the same cell, then for the field jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn, the diplomatic_transcript would include both. But the problem states that the user should transcribe exactly as written. So perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" (current value) and \\\"3.900.-\\\" (crossed out), but how to represent it?\\n\\nWait, the image shows the \\\"Jahresgehalt Monatsgehalt Taglohn\\\" cell as having \\\"2900.-\\\", and below that, there's \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out. So the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.- 3.900.-\\\" but with the second line crossed out. However, the problem says to include all text as written, so diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\" followed by \\\"3.900.-\\\" crossed out.\\n\\nBut how to represent the crossed-out text in the diplomatic_transcript? The problem says to include all formatting. So the diplomatic_transcript would be \\\"2900.-\\\\n3.900.-\\\" but with the second line crossed out. However, in JSON, we can't represent the line break and crossing out in a string. But the user's example uses \\\"Fr. 2'400.-\\\" which is a single string.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the crossed-out text is not part of the current field's value. Since the current value is \\\"2900.-\\\", and the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a correction that was made but crossed out, so it's not part of the current entry. Therefore, the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\".\\n\\nGiven the ambiguity, and considering that the problem's example for salary amounts shows \\\"Fr. 2'400.-\\\" as the diplomatic_transcript, which is a single entry, I think the intended interpretation is that the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is a separate entry or a prior value. However, in this case, since it's written in the same cell, perhaps the diplomatic_transcript is \\\"2900.-\\\".\\n\\nAnother way: the problem states that for interpretation of salary amounts, we need to extract the numeric value. If the diplomatic_transcript has \\\"2900.-\\\", the interpretation is \\\"2900\\\". If there's a crossed-out \\\"3.900.-\\\", it's not part of the current value, so the interpretation is still \\\"2900\\\".\\n\\nTherefore, proceeding with the diplomatic_transcript as \\\"2900.-\\\" and interpretation as \\\"2900\\\".\\n\\nNow, check all required fields:\\n\\nEach field must have diplomatic_transcript, interpretation, and is_crossed_out.\\n\\nFor the empty cells (dienstort, gehaltsklasse), diplomatic_transcript is \\\"\\\", interpretation null, is_crossed_out false.\\n\\nThe row_number is 1.\\n\\nNow, let's check if there are any crossed-out fields. Looking at the image:\\n\\n- Dienstliche Stellung: \\\"Hilfsleiterin\\\" is written normally, no crossing.\\n\\n- Dienstort: empty.\\n\\n- Gehaltsklasse: empty.\\n\\n- Jahresgehalt: \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out; the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out but perhaps in a different part.\\n\\n- Datum: \\\"15. August 1945\\\" is written normally.\\n\\n- Bemerkungen: \\\"+ Zulagen\\\" is written normally.\\n\\nSo is_crossed_out is false for all fields except possibly the salary field, but since \\\"2900.-\\\" is not crossed out, it's false.\\n\\nWait, but the \\\"3.900.-\\\" is crossed out. However, if it's in a different cell or part of the same cell, but not the current value, then the is_crossed_out for the salary field is false.\\n\\nTherefore, all is_crossed_out fields are false.\\n\\nNow, let's put it all together.\\n\\nThe final JSON should have one row with row_number 1, and each field filled accordingly.\\n\"}]},\"native_finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"created\":1770656226,\"model\":\"qwen/qwen3-vl-8b-thinking\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":null,\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":7224,\"prompt_tokens\":5243,\"total_tokens\":12467,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"accepted_prediction_tokens\":null,\"audio_tokens\":null,\"reasoning_tokens\":6937,\"rejected_prediction_tokens\":null,\"image_tokens\":0},\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"audio_tokens\":0,\"cached_tokens\":0,\"video_tokens\":0},\"cost\":0.01611414,\"is_byok\":false,\"cost_details\":{\"upstream_inference_cost\":null,\"upstream_inference_prompt_cost\":0.00094374,\"upstream_inference_completions_cost\":0.0151704}},\"provider\":\"Alibaba\"}"
