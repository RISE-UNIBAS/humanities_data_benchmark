The user's problem statement says: \\\"The card contains rows documenting employment history...\\\" but in the image, there are no filled rows. So, maybe it's a trick question where the table is empty.\\n\\nWait, looking at the problem statement's example of the JSON structure, it's an array of rows.

Let me check the image again. The image shows a personnel card with headers, but all the rows below are empty. So there are no actual data entries.
