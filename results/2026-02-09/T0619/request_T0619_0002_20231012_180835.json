The user provided a JSON schema and a task to extract information from a personnel card table. First, I need to understand exactly what's required.\\n\\nThe main goal is to create a structured JSON object based on the given schema. The user specified that the output must strictly follow the JSON structure they provided, with specific rules for each field.\\n\\nLooking at the provided image, it's a personnel card table. However, the image shows an empty table with headers. All the cells under the headers seem to be blank. There's no data filled in any of the rows. The task says to extract all information from the table, but if the table is empty, then there's nothing to extract.\\n\\nWait, the user mentioned \\\"ROWS DOCUMENTING EMPLOYMENT HISTORY\\\", but the image shows an empty table. So, according to the rules, empty rows should be omitted. The instructions state: \\\"Include ALL rows that have ANY content in ANY column. Empty rows (all cells empty) should be omitted.\\\"\\n\\nSince all cells are empty, there are no rows to include. Therefore, the rows array should be empty.\\n\\nBut let me double-check the COLUMN DEFINITIONS. The columns are dienstliche_stellung, dienstort, gehaltsklasse, jahresgehalt_monatsgehalt_taglohn, datum_gehalts\u00e4nderung, bemerkungen. Each of these columns in the table is empty. So every cell in every row is empty.\\n\\nAccording to the FIELD EXTRACTION RULES, for diplomatic_transcript, if the cell is empty, use an empty string. For interpretation, if the field is empty, it can be null. But since all fields are empty, each row would have diplomatic_transcript as empty string, interpretation as null, and is_crossed_out as false.\\n\\nWait, but the problem states: \\\"Include ALL rows that have ANY content in ANY column\\\". Since there's no content in any column, there are no rows to include. So the rows array would be empty.\\n\\nBut the user's example shows an array with one row. However, in this case, the table has no data. So the correct JSON should have an empty rows array.\\n\\nWait, let's check the example structure. The example has:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"rows\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"row_number\\\": 1,\\n      ... \\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nBut if there are no rows with content, the rows array is empty.\\n\\nSo the final JSON should be:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"rows\\\": []\\n}\\n\\nBut wait, the problem says: \\\"Every field must have all three sub-fields: diplomatic_transcript, interpretation, is_crossed_out\\\". However, if the rows array is empty, there are no rows to have those fields. So the structure is correct.\\n\\nWait, the required JSON structure has \\\"rows\\\" as an array, and each element is a row with all the required fields. If there are no rows, the array is empty.\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be an empty rows array.\\n\\nBut let me check again. The user says: \\\"Include ALL rows that have ANY content in ANY column. Empty rows (all cells empty) should be omitted.\\\"\\n\\nSince all cells are empty, no rows are included. Therefore, the JSON has an empty array for rows.\\n\\nAnother check: The \\\"diplomatic_transcript\\\" must be a string, even if empty. But the user's instructions say \\\"Use empty string \\\"\\\" for empty cells\\\". So for each field in the row, diplomatic_transcript is \\\"\\\", interpretation is null, is_crossed_out is false.\\n\\nBut since there are no rows, we don't have to process any fields.\\n\\nYes, so the correct output is a JSON object with \\\"rows\\\" as an empty array.\\n\\nWait, but maybe the user made a mistake in the image.
