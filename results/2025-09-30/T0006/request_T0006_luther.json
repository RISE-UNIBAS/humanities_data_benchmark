The document is formatted in two columns with numbered theses, and its content represents one of the most significant theological and historical documents of the 16th century that sparked the Protestant Reformation.\n\nThe format appears to be the original printed version of the theses, which would have been produced shortly after Luther reportedly nailed them to the door of the Wittenberg Castle Church in 1517.",
