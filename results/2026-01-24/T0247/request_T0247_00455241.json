The user wants me to extract bibliographic information from an index card into a specific JSON format. Let me start by understanding the given instructions and the provided example.\\n\\nFirst, the task is to parse the index card and structure the data according to the specified schema. The key points are:\\n\\n1. **Card Type**: Check if there's a note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line. If yes, it's a \\\"Reference\\\"; otherwise, it's a \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\". Looking at the card, there's \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" which might indicate \\\"Dissertation\\\", but I need to check if there's an \\\"s.\\\" note. The card has \\\"Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" and \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" \u2014 no \\\"s.\\\" line, so it's a Dissertation.\\n\\n2. **Author**: The author is listed as \\\"Pedrosa, Agustin\\\". The name is given as \\\"Pedrosa, Agustin\\\", so last_name is Pedrosa, first_name is Agustin.\\n\\n3. **Publication Details**:\\n   - Title: \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n   - Year: 1961 (from \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\")\\n   - Place: \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" (which is Fribourg, Switzerland)\\n   - Pages: \\\"8' 71 S.\\\" \u2014 The instruction says to remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix. Wait, \\\"S.\\\" here is probably a typo or abbreviation. Wait, the example says \\\"pages: Page count (remove 'S.' suffix if present)\\\". The \\\"71 S.\\\" would become \\\"71\\\" since S. is suffix. Wait, but in the original text, it's \\\"8' 71 S.\\\" \u2014 the 'S.' is likely \\\"S.\\\" as in \\\"S.\\\" for \\\"Seiten\\\" (German for pages), so the pages are 71. But the instruction says to remove \\\"S.\\\" if present, so \\\"71 S.\\\" becomes \\\"71\\\".\\n   - Publisher: The card has \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" as the place, but the publisher isn't explicitly mentioned. Wait, \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" \u2014 maybe the publisher is Friburgo? Or perhaps the university? In some cases, the publisher is the university. The card says \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\", which might be the place of publication. So publisher might be \\\"Universidad de Friburgo\\\" or similar, but the example doesn't specify. Wait, the user says \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". Since it's a dissertation, the publisher is often the institution. So perhaps \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" is the institution, so publisher would be \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\".\\n   - Format: The card mentions \\\"8' 71 S.\\\" \u2014 the \\\"8'\\\" is the format, which is common for book sizes. So format is \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\n4. **Library Reference**:\\n   - Shelfmark: \\\"Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" \u2014 Shelfmark is \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\".\\n   - Subjects: The card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" \u2014 \\\"Mariale\\\" might be the subject, and \\\"Th Diss\\\" for Thesis. So subjects would be \\\"Mariale, Thesis\\\".\\n\\nWait, checking the extraction rules again:\\n\\nFor Publication, the \\\"pages\\\" should be \\\"71\\\" (since \\\"71 S.\\\" becomes \\\"71\\\"). The format is \\\"8'\\\", so format is \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\nShelfmark: \\\"Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" \u2014 the shelfmark is \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\".\\n\\nSubjects: The card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" \u2014 maybe \\\"Mariale\\\" is the subject, and \\\"Th Diss\\\" is a note. So subjects would be \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nWait, the example says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\". So \\\"Mariale\\\" is a keyword. Also, \\\"Th Diss\\\" might be a note, but perhaps the subjects are \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\". But since the example says \\\"keywords\\\", maybe just \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nWait, looking at the card:\\n\\n\\\"Pedrosa, Agustin. El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>. -- Friburgo <Suiza> 1961. -- 8' 71 S. Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961 Mariale/ Th Diss\\\"\\n\\nThe \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" might be part of the subject. So subjects could be \\\"Mariale, Thesis\\\".\\n\\nBut according to rule 4: subjects are \\\"Subject classifications or keywords\\\". So \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\".\\n\\nWait, the instruction says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\". So perhaps the subjects are \\\"Mariale\\\" as the main subject, and \\\"Thesis\\\" as a type. But the card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\", so \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\".\\n\\nBut the exact subjects would need to be extracted. However, in the card, it's \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\", which might mean \\\"Mariale\\\" (subject) and \\\"Thesis\\\" (type). So subjects would be \\\"Mariale, Thesis\\\".\\n\\nWait, but the user says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\", so maybe it's \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nAlternatively, the \\\"Th Diss\\\" might be \\\"Thesis\\\" as the type of work, but the work type is already specified as \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\". So maybe subjects are just \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nHmm, perhaps the subjects here are \\\"Mariale\\\" as the main keyword.\\n\\nNow, checking the Publication fields:\\n\\n- title: \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, the title in the card is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nBut the instruction says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So perhaps \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\" is the main title, and the rest is part of the subtitle or description. However, the card writes it as \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" \u2014 so the main title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and the rest is a subtitle. But in bibliographic entries, sometimes the entire phrase is the title. However, the extraction rule says \\\"the main title of the work\\\", so maybe \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\" is the main title.\\n\\nWait, the user's example has the title as \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" but in the JSON, the title should be the main title. Wait, looking at the example structure, the title field is \\\"string\\\", so the entire title as per the card.\\n\\nBut let's check the card: \\\"Pedrosa, Agustin. El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nSo the title would be \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" but perhaps the \\\"Extracto de la Tesis...\\\" is part of the title. Wait, maybe the title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" is a subtitle or additional info.\\n\\nBut the user's instruction says to extract the main title. However, given the instructions, perhaps the entire title as written is the title field. Let me check the example given in the extraction rules: in the example, if the card has a title like \\\"Title of Work\\\", then the title field is that. So here, the title would be \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nBut let's look at the specific card:\\n\\n\\\"Pedrosa, Agustin. El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nSo the title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" is probably part of the title. Maybe the main title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and the rest is the subtitle. But the instructions don't specify to split titles, so perhaps it's all part of the title.\\n\\nHowever, the user's example might be different. Let me check the problem statement again. The user says: \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So the main title, which is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\". The rest could be considered as part of the publication details (like subtitle), but according to the extraction rules, the title is just the main title.\\n\\nWait, the card says \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" So perhaps the main title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and the rest is a note. But the extraction rule says to take the main title as per the work.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the entire phrase is the title. The user's example in the schema has \\\"title\\\": \\\"string\\\", so we need to take all the title text.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" But maybe the \\\"Extracto de la Tesis...\\\" is part of the title. Alternatively, it's a subtitle. Hmm.\\n\\nBut the problem states to extract \\\"the main title of the work\\\". So the main title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\". The \\\"Extracto de la Tesis...\\\" is part of the publication details (maybe the subtitle). However, the user's instructions don't specify to separate title and subtitle. So perhaps the title should be \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the user's example in the schema shows \\\"title\\\": \\\"string\\\", so we can take the entire title as written.\\n\\nLet me proceed with the title as \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but looking at the example input, the title field would include all that. However, the problem says \\\"main title\\\", which is usually the first part. But given the instructions, perhaps the entire title as written.\\n\\nWait, the user provided the following card:\\n\\n\\\"Pedrosa, Agustin. El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>. -- Friburgo <Suiza> 1961. -- 8' 71 S. Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961 Mariale/ Th Diss\\\"\\n\\nSo the title would be \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" but perhaps the first part is the title, and the rest is a subtitle. However, since the user says \\\"main title\\\", maybe \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\" is the title.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and \\\"Extracto de la Tesis...\\\" is a subtitle. But the instructions don't specify to split, so perhaps include both.\\n\\nBut given the ambiguity, I'll go with the entire title as written: \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the card lists the title as \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" So the title is the entire phrase.\\n\\nNow, for the year: 1961, which is present.\\n\\nPlace: \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" as per \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\".\\n\\nPages: \\\"8' 71 S.\\\" \u2014 the instruction says to remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix if present, so it becomes \\\"71\\\".\\n\\nPublisher: The card states \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\", which is the place. However, the publisher is the institution. In many cases, for dissertations, the publisher is the university. Since it's a dissertation from Friburgo (Fribourg), the publisher might be the university. However, the card has \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\", so the publisher could be \\\"Friburgo\\\" or \\\"Universidad de Friburgo\\\", but the exact name isn't specified. But the extraction rule says to take the publisher as \\\"Publishing house/institution\\\", so maybe \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\".\\n\\nFormat: \\\"8'\\\", which is the format.\\n\\nLibrary Reference:\\n\\nShelfmark: \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" (from \\\"Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\")\\n\\nSubjects: The card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\". So \\\"Mariale\\\" is the subject keyword, and \\\"Th Diss\\\" might be a note, but according to the rules, subjects are keywords. So \\\"Mariale\\\" as the subject.\\n\\nWait, but \\\"Th Diss\\\" might stand for \\\"Thesis Dissertation\\\", so perhaps the subjects are \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\". But the problem says \\\"subject classifications or keywords\\\", so \\\"Mariale\\\" is the main keyword.\\n\\nNow, checking the rules for missing information: use empty string for missing fields. For example, publisher might be missing if not explicitly stated, but here it's part of the place. Wait, no: the place is \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\", publisher is the institution. Since it's a dissertation, the publisher is likely the university. But the card has \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\", so perhaps publisher is \\\"Friburgo\\\".\\n\\nBut let's confirm:\\n\\n- Place: Publication place, which is Friburgo (Fribourg), Switzerland.\\n\\n- Publisher: Publishing house/institution, which for a dissertation is typically the university. However, in some cases, the publisher might be listed as the institution. Since the card says \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\", the publisher is probably the University of Fribourg.\\n\\nBut the card doesn't explicitly state \\\"Universidad de Friburgo\\\" or similar. However, in bibliographic entries, sometimes the place of publication is listed as the publisher. For example, \\\"New York: University of New York Press\\\", etc. So here, the publisher would be \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\".\\n\\nWait, but the instruction says \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". So if the place is Friburgo, the publisher is the university there.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the publisher is not listed, so it's empty. But the user says to omit year fields if not present, but for publisher, if not present, use empty string.\\n\\nWait, let's check the card again:\\n\\n\\\"Pedrosa, Agustin. El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>. -- Friburgo <Suiza> 1961. -- 8' 71 S. Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961 Mariale/ Th Diss\\\"\\n\\nThe \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\" is the place and year. The publisher isn't explicitly mentioned, so maybe it's empty.\\n\\nWait, but in the card, \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" \u2014 \\\"Extracto de la Tesis\\\" would mean \\\"Extract of the Thesis\\\", so the thesis was done at Friburgo (Switzerland), and the publisher might be the university there.\\n\\nBut without explicit mention, perhaps the publisher is empty.\\n\\nWait, the rules say to use empty string if missing. So if the publisher isn't explicitly mentioned, then it's empty.\\n\\nSimilarly, format is \\\"8'\\\", which is specified.\\n\\nNow, the author: \\\"Pedrosa, Agustin\\\" \u2014 last_name is Pedrosa, first_name is Agustin.\\n\\nWork type: \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\" since there's no \\\"s.\\\" line.\\n\\nShelfmark: \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" as per Standort.\\n\\nSubjects: \\\"Mariale\\\" (from \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\").\\n\\nWait, but \\\"Th Diss\\\" might be \\\"Thesis Dissertation\\\", but the subjects should be keywords. So \\\"Mariale\\\" is the main subject.\\n\\nNow, putting it all together.\\n\\nCheck the year: \\\"1961\\\" as integer.\\n\\nPlace: \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" \u2014 as a string.\\n\\nPages: \\\"71\\\" (since \\\"71 S.\\\" becomes \\\"71\\\").\\n\\nFormat: \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\nLibrary Reference:\\n\\n- shelfmark: \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\"\\n\\n- subjects: \\\"Mariale\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" \u2014 so perhaps subjects are \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\", but separated by slash. However, the rule says \\\"subject classifications or keywords\\\", so maybe combined as \\\"Mariale, Thesis\\\".\\n\\nBut the example might have it as \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nAlternatively, \\\"Th Diss\\\" is a note, so perhaps only \\\"Mariale\\\" is the subject.\\n\\nNow, verifying each field:\\n\\n- type: \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\"\\n\\n- author: {\\\"last_name\\\": \\\"Pedrosa\\\", \\\"first_name\\\": \\\"Agustin\\\"}\\n\\n- publication:\\n\\n  - title: \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul.

The card says \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\", which is the place. But the publisher isn't explicitly stated. So publisher field should be empty string.\\n\\nWait, but the instruction says \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". For a dissertation, the publisher is typically the university. But if not specified, maybe it's empty.\\n\\nSo publisher: \\\"\\\"\\n\\nBut let's check the example card. If it's a dissertation, the publisher is the university. So maybe the publisher is \\\"University of Fribourg\\\" or similar. But the card doesn't state it. So perhaps leave it as empty.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the publisher is \\\"Friburgo\\\" as the institution.\\n\\nWait, the problem states to extract the information as per the card. The card does not specify the publisher name, only the place. So publisher field would be empty.\\n\\nSimilarly, the format is \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\nPublication:\\n\\n- title: \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\n- year: 1961\\n\\n- place: \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\"\\n\\n- pages: \\\"71\\\"\\n\\n- publisher: \\\"\\\"\\n\\n- format: \\\"8'\\\"\\n\\nLibrary Reference:\\n\\n- shelfmark: \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\"\\n\\n- subjects: \\\"Mariale\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" \u2014 perhaps the subjects are \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\". But the rule says to extract subject classifications or keywords.

The extraction rule says \\\"year: integer\\\" \u2014 so 1961 as integer.\\n\\nThe problem states: \\\"year: integer\\\".\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, the final JSON.\\n\\nLet me write it out.\\n\",\"reasoning_details\":[{\"format\":\"unknown\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"reasoning.text\",\"text\":\"Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract bibliographic information from an index card into a specific JSON format. Let me start by understanding the given instructions and the provided example.\\n\\nFirst, the task is to parse the index card and structure the data according to the specified schema. The key points are:\\n\\n1. **Card Type**: Check if there's a note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line. If yes, it's a \\\"Reference\\\"; otherwise, it's a \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\". Looking at the card, there's \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" which might indicate \\\"Dissertation\\\", but I need to check if there's an \\\"s.\\\" note. The card has \\\"Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" and \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" \u2014 no \\\"s.\\\" line, so it's a Dissertation.\\n\\n2. **Author**: The author is listed as \\\"Pedrosa, Agustin\\\". The name is given as \\\"Pedrosa, Agustin\\\", so last_name is Pedrosa, first_name is Agustin.\\n\\n3. **Publication Details**:\\n   - Title: \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n   - Year: 1961 (from \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\")\\n   - Place: \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" (which is Fribourg, Switzerland)\\n   - Pages: \\\"8' 71 S.\\\" \u2014 The instruction says to remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix. Wait, \\\"S.\\\" here is probably a typo or abbreviation. Wait, the example says \\\"pages: Page count (remove 'S.' suffix if present)\\\". The \\\"71 S.\\\" would become \\\"71\\\" since S. is suffix. Wait, but in the original text, it's \\\"8' 71 S.\\\" \u2014 the 'S.' is likely \\\"S.\\\" as in \\\"S.\\\" for \\\"Seiten\\\" (German for pages), so the pages are 71. But the instruction says to remove \\\"S.\\\" if present, so \\\"71 S.\\\" becomes \\\"71\\\".\\n   - Publisher: The card has \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" as the place, but the publisher isn't explicitly mentioned. Wait, \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" \u2014 maybe the publisher is Friburgo? Or perhaps the university? In some cases, the publisher is the university. The card says \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\", which might be the place of publication. So publisher might be \\\"Universidad de Friburgo\\\" or similar, but the example doesn't specify. Wait, the user says \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". Since it's a dissertation, the publisher is often the institution. So perhaps \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" is the institution, so publisher would be \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\".\\n   - Format: The card mentions \\\"8' 71 S.\\\" \u2014 the \\\"8'\\\" is the format, which is common for book sizes. So format is \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\n4. **Library Reference**:\\n   - Shelfmark: \\\"Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" \u2014 Shelfmark is \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\".\\n   - Subjects: The card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" \u2014 \\\"Mariale\\\" might be the subject, and \\\"Th Diss\\\" for Thesis. So subjects would be \\\"Mariale, Thesis\\\".\\n\\nWait, checking the extraction rules again:\\n\\nFor Publication, the \\\"pages\\\" should be \\\"71\\\" (since \\\"71 S.\\\" becomes \\\"71\\\"). The format is \\\"8'\\\", so format is \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\nShelfmark: \\\"Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" \u2014 the shelfmark is \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\".\\n\\nSubjects: The card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" \u2014 maybe \\\"Mariale\\\" is the subject, and \\\"Th Diss\\\" is a note. So subjects would be \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nWait, the example says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\". So \\\"Mariale\\\" is a keyword. Also, \\\"Th Diss\\\" might be a note, but perhaps the subjects are \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\". But since the example says \\\"keywords\\\", maybe just \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nWait, looking at the card:\\n\\n\\\"Pedrosa, Agustin. El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>. -- Friburgo <Suiza> 1961. -- 8' 71 S. Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961 Mariale/ Th Diss\\\"\\n\\nThe \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\" might be part of the subject. So subjects could be \\\"Mariale, Thesis\\\".\\n\\nBut according to rule 4: subjects are \\\"Subject classifications or keywords\\\". So \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\".\\n\\nWait, the instruction says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\". So perhaps the subjects are \\\"Mariale\\\" as the main subject, and \\\"Thesis\\\" as a type. But the card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\", so \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\".\\n\\nBut the exact subjects would need to be extracted. However, in the card, it's \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\", which might mean \\\"Mariale\\\" (subject) and \\\"Thesis\\\" (type). So subjects would be \\\"Mariale, Thesis\\\".\\n\\nWait, but the user says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\", so maybe it's \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nAlternatively, the \\\"Th Diss\\\" might be \\\"Thesis\\\" as the type of work, but the work type is already specified as \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\". So maybe subjects are just \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nHmm, perhaps the subjects here are \\\"Mariale\\\" as the main keyword.\\n\\nNow, checking the Publication fields:\\n\\n- title: \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, the title in the card is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nBut the instruction says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So perhaps \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\" is the main title, and the rest is part of the subtitle or description. However, the card writes it as \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" \u2014 so the main title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and the rest is a subtitle. But in bibliographic entries, sometimes the entire phrase is the title. However, the extraction rule says \\\"the main title of the work\\\", so maybe \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\" is the main title.\\n\\nWait, the user's example has the title as \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" but in the JSON, the title should be the main title. Wait, looking at the example structure, the title field is \\\"string\\\", so the entire title as per the card.\\n\\nBut let's check the card: \\\"Pedrosa, Agustin. El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nSo the title would be \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" but perhaps the \\\"Extracto de la Tesis...\\\" is part of the title. Wait, maybe the title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" is a subtitle or additional info.\\n\\nBut the user's instruction says to extract the main title. However, given the instructions, perhaps the entire title as written is the title field. Let me check the example given in the extraction rules: in the example, if the card has a title like \\\"Title of Work\\\", then the title field is that. So here, the title would be \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nBut let's look at the specific card:\\n\\n\\\"Pedrosa, Agustin. El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nSo the title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" is probably part of the title. Maybe the main title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and the rest is the subtitle. But the instructions don't specify to split titles, so perhaps it's all part of the title.\\n\\nHowever, the user's example might be different. Let me check the problem statement again. The user says: \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So the main title, which is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\". The rest could be considered as part of the publication details (like subtitle), but according to the extraction rules, the title is just the main title.\\n\\nWait, the card says \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" So perhaps the main title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and the rest is a note. But the extraction rule says to take the main title as per the work.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the entire phrase is the title. The user's example in the schema has \\\"title\\\": \\\"string\\\", so we need to take all the title text.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" But maybe the \\\"Extracto de la Tesis...\\\" is part of the title. Alternatively, it's a subtitle. Hmm.\\n\\nBut the problem states to extract \\\"the main title of the work\\\". So the main title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\". The \\\"Extracto de la Tesis...\\\" is part of the publication details (maybe the subtitle). However, the user's instructions don't specify to separate title and subtitle. So perhaps the title should be \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the user's example in the schema shows \\\"title\\\": \\\"string\\\", so we can take the entire title as written.\\n\\nLet me proceed with the title as \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but looking at the example input, the title field would include all that. However, the problem says \\\"main title\\\", which is usually the first part. But given the instructions, perhaps the entire title as written.\\n\\nWait, the user provided the following card:\\n\\n\\\"Pedrosa, Agustin. El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>. -- Friburgo <Suiza> 1961. -- 8' 71 S. Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961 Mariale/ Th Diss\\\"\\n\\nSo the title would be \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" but perhaps the first part is the title, and the rest is a subtitle. However, since the user says \\\"main title\\\", maybe \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\" is the title.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the title is \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul\\\", and \\\"Extracto de la Tesis...\\\" is a subtitle. But the instructions don't specify to split, so perhaps include both.\\n\\nBut given the ambiguity, I'll go with the entire title as written: \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the card lists the title as \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul. Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>.\\\" So the title is the entire phrase.\\n\\nNow, for the year: 1961, which is present.\\n\\nPlace: \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" as per \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\".\\n\\nPages: \\\"8' 71 S.\\\" \u2014 the instruction says to remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix if present, so it becomes \\\"71\\\".\\n\\nPublisher: The card states \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\", which is the place. However, the publisher is the institution. In many cases, for dissertations, the publisher is the university. Since it's a dissertation from Friburgo (Fribourg), the publisher might be the university. However, the card has \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\", so the publisher could be \\\"Friburgo\\\" or \\\"Universidad de Friburgo\\\", but the exact name isn't specified. But the extraction rule says to take the publisher as \\\"Publishing house/institution\\\", so maybe \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\".\\n\\nFormat: \\\"8'\\\", which is the format.\\n\\nLibrary Reference:\\n\\nShelfmark: \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" (from \\\"Standort: Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\")\\n\\nSubjects: The card has \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\". So \\\"Mariale\\\" is the subject keyword, and \\\"Th Diss\\\" might be a note, but according to the rules, subjects are keywords. So \\\"Mariale\\\" as the subject.\\n\\nWait, but \\\"Th Diss\\\" might stand for \\\"Thesis Dissertation\\\", so perhaps the subjects are \\\"Mariale\\\" and \\\"Thesis\\\". But the problem says \\\"subject classifications or keywords\\\", so \\\"Mariale\\\" is the main keyword.\\n\\nNow, checking the rules for missing information: use empty string for missing fields. For example, publisher might be missing if not explicitly stated, but here it's part of the place. Wait, no: the place is \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\", publisher is the institution. Since it's a dissertation, the publisher is likely the university. But the card has \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\", so perhaps publisher is \\\"Friburgo\\\".\\n\\nBut let's confirm:\\n\\n- Place: Publication place, which is Friburgo (Fribourg), Switzerland.\\n\\n- Publisher: Publishing house/institution, which for a dissertation is typically the university. However, in some cases, the publisher might be listed as the institution. Since the card says \\\"Friburgo <Suiza> 1961\\\", the publisher is probably the University of Fribourg.\\n\\nBut the card doesn't explicitly state \\\"Universidad de Friburgo\\\" or similar. However, in bibliographic entries, sometimes the place of publication is listed as the publisher. For example, \\\"New York: University of New York Press\\\", etc. So here, the publisher would be \\\"Friburgo <Suiza>\\\".\\n\\nWait, but the instruction says \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". So if the place is Friburgo, the publisher is the university there.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the publisher is not listed, so it's empty. But the user says to omit year fields if not present, but for publisher, if not present, use empty string.\\n\\nWait, let's check the card again:\\n\\n\\\"Pedrosa, Agustin.

The publisher isn't explicitly mentioned, so maybe it's empty.\\n\\nWait, but in the card, \\\"Extracto de la Tesis Friburgo <Suiza>\\\" \u2014 \\\"Extracto de la Tesis\\\" would mean \\\"Extract of the Thesis\\\", so the thesis was done at Friburgo (Switzerland), and the publisher might be the university there.\\n\\nBut without explicit mention, perhaps the publisher is empty.\\n\\nWait, the rules say to use empty string if missing. So if the publisher isn't explicitly mentioned, then it's empty.\\n\\nSimilarly, format is \\\"8'\\\", which is specified.\\n\\nNow, the author: \\\"Pedrosa, Agustin\\\" \u2014 last_name is Pedrosa, first_name is Agustin.\\n\\nWork type: \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\" since there's no \\\"s.\\\" line.\\n\\nShelfmark: \\\"Diss.Fribourg 1961\\\" as per Standort.\\n\\nSubjects: \\\"Mariale\\\" (from \\\"Mariale/ Th Diss\\\").\\n\\nWait, but \\\"Th Diss\\\" might be \\\"Thesis Dissertation\\\", but the subjects should be keywords.

However, the rule says \\\"subject classifications or keywords\\\", so maybe combined as \\\"Mariale, Thesis\\\".\\n\\nBut the example might have it as \\\"Mariale\\\".\\n\\nAlternatively, \\\"Th Diss\\\" is a note, so perhaps only \\\"Mariale\\\" is the subject.\\n\\nNow, verifying each field:\\n\\n- type: \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\"\\n\\n- author: {\\\"last_name\\\": \\\"Pedrosa\\\", \\\"first_name\\\": \\\"Agustin\\\"}\\n\\n- publication:\\n\\n  - title: \\\"El Mariale de Saint-Evroul.
