We must extract bibliographic information and return it as a structured JSON object.\\n\\nSteps:\\n\\n1. Determine the type of work:\\n   - Rule 1: If the card contains the note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it is a \\\"Reference\\\". Otherwise, it is \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\".\\n   - Looking at the card: \\n        There is a note \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\" but note that \\\"s.\\\" is not explicitly written as a separate line. However, note that the first part of the card ends with \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" and then the next line is \\\"Standort: ...\\\". \\n        But wait, the rule says: \\\"If a card contains the note 's.' on a separate line, it is a 'Reference'\\\". In this card, we do not see the exact note \\\"s.\\\" (which might be the abbreviation for \\\"Schriften\\\" or similar). However, note the second part of the card: \\n          \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n        Here, the word \\\"Diss\\\" appears at the end. But the rule says: look for the note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line. We don't see \\\"s.\\\" as a standalone note.\\n\\n   - Let's read the card again: \\n        The card has two parts. The first part is:\\n          \\\"W e t z, Klaus. H\u00e4matologische und immunologische Ver\u00e4nderungen nach Thymektomie bei Kaninchen. Eine Verlaufsbeobachtung \u00fcber 22 Monate. Diss.Mainz. -- Mainz 1970. -- 8' 39,12 S.\\\"\\n        Then the next line is: \\n          \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\"\\n        And then there is a second part: \\n          \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n\\n   - The rule says: if there is a note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, then it's a Reference. But note: the card has the word \\\"Diss.\\\" in multiple places. However, the rule is about the note \\\"s.\\\" (which might stand for \\\"Schriften\\\" or \\\"Sonderausgabe\\\" or similar). \\n\\n   - Actually, the rule says: \\\"If a card contains the note 's.' on a separate line\\\". In the card, we see:\\n        \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n     This does not have an \\\"s.\\\" note. But note: the card also has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\" and then the word \\\"Diss\\\" at the end of the second part. \\n\\n   - However, the first part of the card explicitly says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is the standard abbreviation for \\\"Dissertation\\\". Therefore, we have a dissertation.\\n\\n   - Also, the rule does not say to look for \\\"Diss\\\", but for \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line. There is no separate line with \\\"s.\\\" (like \\\"s.\\\" meaning \\\"Schriften\\\" or \\\"Sonderausgabe\\\"). So it is not a Reference.\\n\\n   - Conclusion: type = \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\"\\n\\n2. Author:\\n   - The author is written as: \\\"W e t z, Klaus.\\\" -> Note: the middle letter 'e' is written as 'e' but then the next letter is space? Actually, it's \\\"W e t z\\\", which is probably \\\"Wetz\\\". \\n   - So the last name is \\\"Wetz\\\" and first name is \\\"Klaus\\\".\\n   - But note: the card says \\\"W e t z, Klaus.\\\" -> so it's \\\"Wetz\\\" (with the 'e' and 't' separated? Actually, in German, sometimes names are written with spaces for clarity but then we remove the spaces). \\n   - Therefore, we take \\\"Wetz\\\" as the last name and \\\"Klaus\\\" as the first name.\\n\\n3. Publication:\\n   - title: \\\"H\u00e4matologische und immunologische Ver\u00e4nderungen nach Thymektomie bei Kaninchen. Eine Verlaufsbeobachtung \u00fcber 22 Monate.\\\"\\n     (Note: there is a trailing period and then \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is part of the publication info, but the title should be the main title without the dissertation indicator. The title ends with \\\"\u00fcber 22 Monate.\\\")\\n   - year: \\\"1970\\\" -> convert to integer: 1970\\n   - place: \\\"Mainz\\\"\\n   - pages: \\\"39,12 S.\\\" -> the rule says: remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix if present. So we get \\\"39,12\\\" (note: the comma is the decimal separator, so it's \\\"39.12\\\" but in German comma is used as decimal, but we are to leave as string? The rule says: \\\"pages: Page count (remove 'S.' suffix if present)\\\" -> so we remove the \\\"S.\\\" -> becomes \\\"39,12\\\". But note: the example output format expects a string. Also, the rule says: \\\"string or empty string\\\". We can leave it as \\\"39,12\\\".\\n   - publisher: \\\"Mainz\\\" -> but wait, the card says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which might mean the dissertation was written at Mainz. However, the publisher should be the institution. In the context of dissertations, the publisher is often the university. So \\\"Mainz\\\" is the city and the university. But note the rule says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". So we can take \\\"Mainz\\\" as the publisher? However, typically the publisher would be the university. But the card doesn't specify the university name. It only says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" meaning dissertation from Mainz. So the publisher would be \\\"Mainz\\\" or perhaps \\\"University of Mainz\\\"? But the card does not write the university name, only the city. \\n\\n     However, looking at the structure: \\n        \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" -> this is the standard way to denote a dissertation from Mainz. The publisher is typically the university. But the card doesn't have the university name. So we have to go by what is written. The card says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" meaning the dissertation is from Mainz. So the publisher is \\\"Mainz\\\".\\n\\n     But note: in the example, the card has \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" and then \\\"Mainz 1970\\\". The place is already \\\"Mainz\\\", so the publisher might be redundant? However, the rule says: publisher is the publishing house/institution. In the context of dissertations, the publisher is the university. But the card does not specify the university, only the city. So we put \\\"Mainz\\\" for publisher.\\n\\n     However, let's check the example card structure: \\n        It says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" -> meaning the dissertation was defended in Mainz (the city) and the publisher is the university of Mainz? But without the university name, we have to use the city. \\n\\n     But note: the publication details section includes \\\"place\\\" and \\\"publisher\\\". The place is \\\"Mainz\\\" and the publisher is also \\\"Mainz\\\"? \\n\\n     Actually, in many contexts, the publisher for a dissertation is the university. So we might write \\\"University of Mainz\\\" but the card doesn't have that. The card only says \\\"Mainz\\\". \\n\\n     Since the card does not specify the university name, we'll use \\\"Mainz\\\" for publisher? But wait, the rule says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". The institution is the university, but without the name, we have to use the city? \\n\\n     However, note the rule: the card has \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is the standard notation. The publisher is implied to be the university of Mainz, but the card does not write \\\"University of Mainz\\\". So we have to use the information provided. \\n\\n     But observe: the card has two mentions of Mainz: \\n        \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" and then \\\"Mainz 1970\\\". \\n\\n     The \\\"Mainz 1970\\\" is the place and year. So the publisher should be the institution that published the dissertation, which is the university. But since the university name is not provided, we have to leave it as the city? \\n\\n     However, the rule says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". Without the institution name, we cannot put more. So we put \\\"Mainz\\\" as the publisher? But that might be ambiguous. \\n\\n     Alternatively, note that the card says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is the dissertation from Mainz. So the publisher is the university of Mainz, but we don't have the name. So we have to write the city? \\n\\n     But the example card also has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\", meaning the location is stored as Diss.1971,3003. \\n\\n     Given the ambiguity, let's look at the rule: the publisher is the publishing house/institution. Since the card does not specify the institution, we have to leave it as empty string? But wait, the card does not have the institution name. \\n\\n     However, note: in the publication details, the publisher is usually the university. But the card does not have the university name. So we have to leave publisher as empty string? \\n\\n     But wait, the rule says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". And the card does have \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" meaning the dissertation was from Mainz, so the institution is the university of Mainz. But we don't have the name. \\n\\n     Since the rule says: \\\"use empty string for missing text fields\\\", and the card does not explicitly write the institution name, we have to put an empty string? \\n\\n     However, the rule also says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". The card doesn't have a separate line for publisher, but the notation \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" implies the publisher is the university of Mainz. But without the name, we can't put it.\\n\\n     But note: the card has \\\"Mainz\\\" in the place. So the publisher might be the same as the place? \\n\\n     Let's see the example card: \\n        \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" -> this is the standard way to write that it's a dissertation from Mainz. So the publisher is the university of Mainz. But we don't have the full name. \\n\\n     However, the problem says: \\\"Extract the bibliographic information\\\". We are only to extract what is written. The card does not have a publisher line. So we cannot put \\\"University of Mainz\\\" because it's not written. \\n\\n     Therefore, we have to leave publisher as empty string? \\n\\n     But wait, the card has \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is part of the title? Actually, the title is written as:\\n        \\\"W e t z, Klaus. H\u00e4matologische und immunologische Ver\u00e4nderungen nach Thymektomie bei Kaninchen. Eine Verlaufsbeobachtung \u00fcber 22 Monate. Diss.Mainz.\\\"\\n\\n     So \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" is part of the title? Or is it the publisher? \\n\\n     In the card, the structure is:\\n        [author] [title] [Diss.Mainz] [place year] ...\\n\\n     Actually, the standard form for a dissertation index card is:\\n        Author. Title. Diss. [University] [Year]\\n\\n     So \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" is the dissertation designation and the university (Mainz). Therefore, the publisher is the university of Mainz. But the card does not spell out the full university name. So we can only use \\\"Mainz\\\" as the publisher? \\n\\n     Given the constraints, and since the rule says to use what is written, we will take the publisher as \\\"Mainz\\\" because it is the university name (in the context of the city). However, note that the card also has \\\"Mainz\\\" in the place. \\n\\n     But wait: the rule says for publisher: \\\"Publishing house/institution\\\". The university is the institution. So we put \\\"Mainz\\\" for publisher.\\n\\n     However, let's compare with the example in the rule: it says the format might be \\\"8\u00b0\\\", \\\"8'\\\", or \\\"4\u00b0\\\". So the publisher is not the format. \\n\\n     We'll put \\\"Mainz\\\" for publisher.\\n\\n   - format: \\\"8'\\\" (from \\\"8' 39,12 S.\\\") -> the rule says: format is usually \\\"8\u00b0\\\", \\\"8'\\\", or \\\"4\u00b0\\\". So we take \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\n4. Library Reference:\\n   - shelfmark: \\\"Diss.1971,3003\\\" (from the line \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\"). But note: the rule says \\\"Often begins with 'Diss.' or 'AT'\\\". So we put \\\"Diss.1971,3003\\\".\\n   - subjects: The second part of the card: \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\" -> this looks like subject classifications. We can extract: \\\"Kaninchen\\\", \\\"Hormone\\\", \\\"endokrine Dr\u00fcsen\\\", \\\"Blut\\\", \\\"Immunit\u00e4t\\\", \\\"med.u.biol\\\". But note: the rule says: \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\". We can combine them as a string: \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\". However, note the structure: it starts with \\\"3/\\\". The \\\"3\\\" might be a classification code. The subjects might be the rest: \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\". But we have to see what the card has.\\n\\n     Actually, the line is: \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n\\n     We see the subjects: \\n        \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     But note: the rule says: \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or tags\\\". So we can take the entire string after the \\\"3/\\\" as the subjects? However, the rule says \\\"string or empty string\\\". We'll put the string as: \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     But note: the card has a trailing \\\"/ /Diss\\\", which is probably not part of the subjects. So we take up to the last slash before the \\\"Diss\\\".\\n\\n     Actually, the subjects are: \\n        \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     However, the card says: \\n        \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n\\n     So the subjects part is: \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     We can remove the trailing \\\"Diss\\\" because it's the work type indicator? But note the rule: the subjects should be the subject classifications. So we take the string without the trailing \\\"Diss\\\" (but the last part is \\\"/ /Diss\\\", so the subjects are everything before the last slash).\\n\\n     Actually, the subjects are: \\n        \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     But note: the first part of the card already has \\\"Kaninchen\\\" in the title?

So the title should not include \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\".\\n\\nBut looking at the card:\\n   \\\"W e t z, Klaus. H\u00e4matologische und immunologische Ver\u00e4nderungen nach Thymektomie bei Kaninchen. Eine Verlaufsbeobachtung \u00fcber 22 Monate. Diss.Mainz.\\\"\\n\\nSo the title is: \\\"H\u00e4matologische und immunologische Ver\u00e4nderungen nach Thymektomie bei Kaninchen. Eine Verlaufsbeobachtung \u00fcber 22 Monate.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, we remove \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" from the title.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the publication details, the place is \\\"Mainz\\\", the year is \\\"1970\\\", and then \\\"8' 39,12 S.\\\" -> we break that down as:\\n   format: \\\"8'\\\"\\n   pages: \\\"39,12\\\" (without the \\\"S.\\\")\\n\\nNow, let's check the entire card:\\n\\nThe card has two parts. The first part is the main entry. The second part is a subject classification? Actually, the index card format often has a main entry and then a reference to the subject (like the line starting with \\\"3/\\\").\\n\\nWe are to extract the main entry for the dissertation. The second part is additional information.\\n\\nSo for the dissertation, we use the first part.\\n\\nTherefore, the extraction is:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"type\\\": \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\",\\n  \\\"author\\\": {\\n    \\\"last_name\\\": \\\"Wetz\\\",\\n    \\\"first_name\\\": \\\"Klaus\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"publication\\\": {\\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"H\u00e4matologische und immunologische Ver\u00e4nderungen nach Thymektomie bei Kaninchen.

Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nBut note: the rule says for the page count: \\\"remove 'S.' suffix if present\\\". The page count is \\\"39,12 S.\\\" -> becomes \\\"39,12\\\". \\n\\nAlso, the rule says: for missing fields, use empty string. We have all fields.\\n\\nOne more note: the author name. The card has \\\"W e t z\\\" with spaces. We are to form the last name as \\\"Wetz\\\" (by removing the spaces). But note: the rule says: \\\"If only one name is given, put it in last_name and leave first_name empty.\\\" -> here we have two names.\\n\\nSo the author is \\\"Wetz\\\" as last name and \\\"Klaus\\\" as first name.\\n\\nLet's code accordingly.\\n\\nNote: the card also has a trailing period in the title? Yes, but it's part of the title. We include it.\\n\\nAlso, the rule says for the title: The main title of the work -> we have the entire string without the \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\".\\n\\nFinally, we output only the JSON.\\n\",\"reasoning_details\":[{\"format\":\"unknown\",\"index\":0,\"type\":\"reasoning.text\",\"text\":\"We are given a text that is an index card. We must extract bibliographic information and return it as a structured JSON object.\\n\\nSteps:\\n\\n1. Determine the type of work:\\n   - Rule 1: If the card contains the note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it is a \\\"Reference\\\". Otherwise, it is \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\".\\n   - Looking at the card: \\n        There is a note \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\" but note that \\\"s.\\\" is not explicitly written as a separate line. However, note that the first part of the card ends with \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" and then the next line is \\\"Standort: ...\\\". \\n        But wait, the rule says: \\\"If a card contains the note 's.' on a separate line, it is a 'Reference'\\\". In this card, we do not see the exact note \\\"s.\\\" (which might be the abbreviation for \\\"Schriften\\\" or similar). However, note the second part of the card: \\n          \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n        Here, the word \\\"Diss\\\" appears at the end. But the rule says: look for the note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line. We don't see \\\"s.\\\" as a standalone note.\\n\\n   - Let's read the card again: \\n        The card has two parts. The first part is:\\n          \\\"W e t z, Klaus. H\u00e4matologische und immunologische Ver\u00e4nderungen nach Thymektomie bei Kaninchen. Eine Verlaufsbeobachtung \u00fcber 22 Monate. Diss.Mainz. -- Mainz 1970. -- 8' 39,12 S.\\\"\\n        Then the next line is: \\n          \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\"\\n        And then there is a second part: \\n          \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n\\n   - The rule says: if there is a note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, then it's a Reference. But note: the card has the word \\\"Diss.\\\" in multiple places. However, the rule is about the note \\\"s.\\\" (which might stand for \\\"Schriften\\\" or \\\"Sonderausgabe\\\" or similar). \\n\\n   - Actually, the rule says: \\\"If a card contains the note 's.' on a separate line\\\". In the card, we see:\\n        \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n     This does not have an \\\"s.\\\" note. But note: the card also has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\" and then the word \\\"Diss\\\" at the end of the second part. \\n\\n   - However, the first part of the card explicitly says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is the standard abbreviation for \\\"Dissertation\\\". Therefore, we have a dissertation.\\n\\n   - Also, the rule does not say to look for \\\"Diss\\\", but for \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line. There is no separate line with \\\"s.\\\" (like \\\"s.\\\" meaning \\\"Schriften\\\" or \\\"Sonderausgabe\\\"). So it is not a Reference.\\n\\n   - Conclusion: type = \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\"\\n\\n2. Author:\\n   - The author is written as: \\\"W e t z, Klaus.\\\" -> Note: the middle letter 'e' is written as 'e' but then the next letter is space? Actually, it's \\\"W e t z\\\", which is probably \\\"Wetz\\\". \\n   - So the last name is \\\"Wetz\\\" and first name is \\\"Klaus\\\".\\n   - But note: the card says \\\"W e t z, Klaus.\\\" -> so it's \\\"Wetz\\\" (with the 'e' and 't' separated? Actually, in German, sometimes names are written with spaces for clarity but then we remove the spaces). \\n   - Therefore, we take \\\"Wetz\\\" as the last name and \\\"Klaus\\\" as the first name.\\n\\n3. Publication:\\n   - title: \\\"H\u00e4matologische und immunologische Ver\u00e4nderungen nach Thymektomie bei Kaninchen. Eine Verlaufsbeobachtung \u00fcber 22 Monate.\\\"\\n     (Note: there is a trailing period and then \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is part of the publication info, but the title should be the main title without the dissertation indicator. The title ends with \\\"\u00fcber 22 Monate.\\\")\\n   - year: \\\"1970\\\" -> convert to integer: 1970\\n   - place: \\\"Mainz\\\"\\n   - pages: \\\"39,12 S.\\\" -> the rule says: remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix if present. So we get \\\"39,12\\\" (note: the comma is the decimal separator, so it's \\\"39.12\\\" but in German comma is used as decimal, but we are to leave as string? The rule says: \\\"pages: Page count (remove 'S.' suffix if present)\\\" -> so we remove the \\\"S.\\\" -> becomes \\\"39,12\\\". But note: the example output format expects a string. Also, the rule says: \\\"string or empty string\\\". We can leave it as \\\"39,12\\\".\\n   - publisher: \\\"Mainz\\\" -> but wait, the card says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which might mean the dissertation was written at Mainz. However, the publisher should be the institution. In the context of dissertations, the publisher is often the university. So \\\"Mainz\\\" is the city and the university. But note the rule says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". So we can take \\\"Mainz\\\" as the publisher? However, typically the publisher would be the university. But the card doesn't specify the university name. It only says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" meaning dissertation from Mainz. So the publisher would be \\\"Mainz\\\" or perhaps \\\"University of Mainz\\\"? But the card does not write the university name, only the city. \\n\\n     However, looking at the structure: \\n        \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" -> this is the standard way to denote a dissertation from Mainz. The publisher is typically the university. But the card doesn't have the university name. So we have to go by what is written. The card says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" meaning the dissertation is from Mainz. So the publisher is \\\"Mainz\\\".\\n\\n     But note: in the example, the card has \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" and then \\\"Mainz 1970\\\". The place is already \\\"Mainz\\\", so the publisher might be redundant? However, the rule says: publisher is the publishing house/institution. In the context of dissertations, the publisher is the university. But the card does not specify the university, only the city. So we put \\\"Mainz\\\" for publisher.\\n\\n     However, let's check the example card structure: \\n        It says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" -> meaning the dissertation was defended in Mainz (the city) and the publisher is the university of Mainz? But without the university name, we have to use the city. \\n\\n     But note: the publication details section includes \\\"place\\\" and \\\"publisher\\\". The place is \\\"Mainz\\\" and the publisher is also \\\"Mainz\\\"? \\n\\n     Actually, in many contexts, the publisher for a dissertation is the university. So we might write \\\"University of Mainz\\\" but the card doesn't have that. The card only says \\\"Mainz\\\". \\n\\n     Since the card does not specify the university name, we'll use \\\"Mainz\\\" for publisher? But wait, the rule says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". The institution is the university, but without the name, we have to use the city? \\n\\n     However, note the rule: the card has \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is the standard notation. The publisher is implied to be the university of Mainz, but the card does not write \\\"University of Mainz\\\". So we have to use the information provided. \\n\\n     But observe: the card has two mentions of Mainz: \\n        \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" and then \\\"Mainz 1970\\\". \\n\\n     The \\\"Mainz 1970\\\" is the place and year. So the publisher should be the institution that published the dissertation, which is the university. But since the university name is not provided, we have to leave it as the city? \\n\\n     However, the rule says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". Without the institution name, we cannot put more. So we put \\\"Mainz\\\" as the publisher? But that might be ambiguous. \\n\\n     Alternatively, note that the card says \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is the dissertation from Mainz. So the publisher is the university of Mainz, but we don't have the name. So we have to write the city? \\n\\n     But the example card also has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\", meaning the location is stored as Diss.1971,3003. \\n\\n     Given the ambiguity, let's look at the rule: the publisher is the publishing house/institution. Since the card does not specify the institution, we have to leave it as empty string? But wait, the card does not have the institution name. \\n\\n     However, note: in the publication details, the publisher is usually the university. But the card does not have the university name. So we have to leave publisher as empty string? \\n\\n     But wait, the rule says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". And the card does have \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" meaning the dissertation was from Mainz, so the institution is the university of Mainz. But we don't have the name. \\n\\n     Since the rule says: \\\"use empty string for missing text fields\\\", and the card does not explicitly write the institution name, we have to put an empty string? \\n\\n     However, the rule also says: \\\"publisher: Publishing house/institution\\\". The card doesn't have a separate line for publisher, but the notation \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" implies the publisher is the university of Mainz. But without the name, we can't put it.\\n\\n     But note: the card has \\\"Mainz\\\" in the place. So the publisher might be the same as the place? \\n\\n     Let's see the example card: \\n        \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" -> this is the standard way to write that it's a dissertation from Mainz. So the publisher is the university of Mainz. But we don't have the full name. \\n\\n     However, the problem says: \\\"Extract the bibliographic information\\\". We are only to extract what is written. The card does not have a publisher line. So we cannot put \\\"University of Mainz\\\" because it's not written. \\n\\n     Therefore, we have to leave publisher as empty string? \\n\\n     But wait, the card has \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" which is part of the title? Actually, the title is written as:\\n        \\\"W e t z, Klaus. H\u00e4matologische und immunologische Ver\u00e4nderungen nach Thymektomie bei Kaninchen. Eine Verlaufsbeobachtung \u00fcber 22 Monate. Diss.Mainz.\\\"\\n\\n     So \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" is part of the title? Or is it the publisher? \\n\\n     In the card, the structure is:\\n        [author] [title] [Diss.Mainz] [place year] ...\\n\\n     Actually, the standard form for a dissertation index card is:\\n        Author. Title. Diss. [University] [Year]\\n\\n     So \\\"Diss.Mainz.\\\" is the dissertation designation and the university (Mainz). Therefore, the publisher is the university of Mainz. But the card does not spell out the full university name. So we can only use \\\"Mainz\\\" as the publisher? \\n\\n     Given the constraints, and since the rule says to use what is written, we will take the publisher as \\\"Mainz\\\" because it is the university name (in the context of the city). However, note that the card also has \\\"Mainz\\\" in the place. \\n\\n     But wait: the rule says for publisher: \\\"Publishing house/institution\\\". The university is the institution. So we put \\\"Mainz\\\" for publisher.\\n\\n     However, let's compare with the example in the rule: it says the format might be \\\"8\u00b0\\\", \\\"8'\\\", or \\\"4\u00b0\\\". So the publisher is not the format. \\n\\n     We'll put \\\"Mainz\\\" for publisher.\\n\\n   - format: \\\"8'\\\" (from \\\"8' 39,12 S.\\\") -> the rule says: format is usually \\\"8\u00b0\\\", \\\"8'\\\", or \\\"4\u00b0\\\". So we take \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\n4. Library Reference:\\n   - shelfmark: \\\"Diss.1971,3003\\\" (from the line \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,3003\\\"). But note: the rule says \\\"Often begins with 'Diss.' or 'AT'\\\". So we put \\\"Diss.1971,3003\\\".\\n   - subjects: The second part of the card: \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\" -> this looks like subject classifications. We can extract: \\\"Kaninchen\\\", \\\"Hormone\\\", \\\"endokrine Dr\u00fcsen\\\", \\\"Blut\\\", \\\"Immunit\u00e4t\\\", \\\"med.u.biol\\\". But note: the rule says: \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\". We can combine them as a string: \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\". However, note the structure: it starts with \\\"3/\\\". The \\\"3\\\" might be a classification code. The subjects might be the rest: \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\". But we have to see what the card has.\\n\\n     Actually, the line is: \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n\\n     We see the subjects: \\n        \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     But note: the rule says: \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or tags\\\". So we can take the entire string after the \\\"3/\\\" as the subjects? However, the rule says \\\"string or empty string\\\". We'll put the string as: \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     But note: the card has a trailing \\\"/ /Diss\\\", which is probably not part of the subjects. So we take up to the last slash before the \\\"Diss\\\".\\n\\n     Actually, the subjects are: \\n        \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     However, the card says: \\n        \\\"3/Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)/ /Diss\\\"\\n\\n     So the subjects part is: \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     We can remove the trailing \\\"Diss\\\" because it's the work type indicator? But note the rule: the subjects should be the subject classifications. So we take the string without the trailing \\\"Diss\\\" (but the last part is \\\"/ /Diss\\\", so the subjects are everything before the last slash).\\n\\n     Actually, the subjects are: \\n        \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n     But note: the first part of the card already has \\\"Kaninchen\\\" in the title? The subjects might be additional classifications. \\n\\n     We'll take: \\\"Kaninchen.Hormone u.endokrine Dr\u00fcsen/Kaninchen. Blut/Immunit\u00e4t(med.u.biol.)\\\"\\n\\n5.
