First, I need to extract the bibliographic information from the provided index card and format it into the specified JSON structure.\\n\\nStarting with the Card Type. The extraction rules say that if there's a note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it's a \\\"Reference\\\". Looking at the card, there's a line that says \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" and then \\\"Diss\\\" on the next line. Wait, the rule mentions \\\"s.\\\" but here it's \\\"Diss.\\\" Maybe that's a typo or different notation. Wait, the user's example shows \\\"s.\\\" as the indicator. Let me check the original card again.\\n\\nThe card has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" followed by \\\"Diss\\\" on a separate line. Hmm, the rule says \\\"if a card contains the note 's.' on a separate line, it is a Reference\\\". Wait, the example here has \\\"Diss.\\\" but maybe \\\"Diss.\\\" is part of the shelfmark. Wait, the user's instructions state that \\\"s.\\\" is the indicator. Wait, looking back: \\\"Card Type: If a card contains the note 's.' on a separate line, it is a 'Reference'. Otherwise, it is a 'Dissertation or thesis'.\\\"\\n\\nWait, the example index card provided in the user's message has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" and then \\\"Diss\\\" on the next line. Wait, maybe the \\\"s.\\\" part is elsewhere. Wait, looking at the card text:\\n\\nThe main text is: \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen. Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009. Diss.T\u00fcbingen. [Illustr.] -- (M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]. -- 8' 298 S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6]. Standort: Diss.1971,888 Diss\\\"\\n\\nWait, maybe there's a line with \\\"s.\\\"? Let me read the card again carefully.\\n\\nThe user's input shows:\\n\\n\\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen. Zur Semiolgie des literari-\\nschen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009.\\nDiss.T\u00fcbingen. [Illustr.] -- (M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]. -- \\n8' 298 S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine \\nLinguistik,Bd.6].\\nStandort: Diss.1971,888\\n\\nDiss\\\"\\n\\nWait, the line \\\"Diss\\\" at the bottom might be the key. The rule says if the card has \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it's a Reference. Wait, the user's example card has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" and then \\\"Diss\\\" on the next line. Wait, maybe \\\"Diss\\\" is a typo for \\\"s.\\\"? Or perhaps \\\"Diss.\\\" is the abbreviation for \\\"Dissertation\\\", so the presence of \\\"Diss.\\\" indicates it's a Dissertation.\\n\\nWait, according to the extraction rules: if there's a note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it's a Reference. Otherwise, it's Dissertation or thesis. So the presence of \\\"Diss\\\" in the text would indicate it's a Dissertation. Wait, in the card, there's \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" which is part of the publication details (Dissertation from T\u00fcbingen), and then \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" followed by \\\"Diss\\\" on a separate line.\\n\\nWait, maybe the \\\"s.\\\" is not present. The rule says if there's an \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line. Let's check the card again. The card's text includes \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" and then \\\"Diss\\\" on the next line. There's no line with \\\"s.\\\" here. The word \\\"Diss\\\" is present, but not \\\"s.\\\" So according to the rule, since there's no \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it's a Dissertation or thesis. So the type should be \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\".\\n\\nNext, the Author. The card says \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen.\\\" Wait, the name is written as \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen.\\\" with a space between Traban and t. Probably a typo, maybe it's \\\"Trabant\\\" but written as \\\"Traban t\\\". The author's name is likely \\\"Trabant, J\u00fcrgen\\\". However, the problem states: if only one name is given, put it in last_name and leave first_name empty. Here, it's \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen\\\" which seems to be a misspelling of \\\"Trabant\\\", so last_name is \\\"Trabant\\\", first_name \\\"J\u00fcrgen\\\".\\n\\nNext, Publication details:\\n\\n- title: The main title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". Wait, the title might be the main work, which is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" with the subtitle in angle brackets. The rule says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So probably \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\n- year: [1971] is present. The year should be 1971 as integer.\\n\\n- place: \\\"(M\u00fcnchen)\\\" is listed here as the publisher's place. Wait, in the text it's \\\"(M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971].\\\". So place is \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\".\\n\\n- pages: \\\"8' 298 S.\\\" The rule says to remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix if present. So pages should be \\\"298\\\".\\n\\n- publisher: \\\"Pink\\\" (since it's (M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971].) Wait, the publisher is \\\"Pink\\\" as per the text. Wait, the structure is (place):publisher [year]. So \\\"(M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971].\\\" so publisher is \\\"Pink\\\".\\n\\n- format: \\\"8'\\\". The format is specified as \\\"8'\\\" in the text.\\n\\nLibrary Reference:\\n\\n- shelfmark: \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" \u2013 shelfmark is \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\".\\n\\n- subjects: The subjects are listed as \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\", but also \\\"[Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6]\\\". However, the rule says subjects are \\\"Subject classifications or keywords\\\". The main subject here might be \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\", but maybe the subjects are the keywords in the brackets. Wait, the card says \\\"8' 298 S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6]\\\". So the subjects could be the \\\"Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6\\\" but perhaps it's part of the library catalog entry. The subjects might be the keywords listed. The rule says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\". The text has \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" in angle brackets, which might be the title of the work, not the subjects. Wait, the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". So the title has a subtitle. But the subjects might be the keywords here. Alternatively, the subjects could be the \\\"Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6\\\" part. Wait, the user's example for subjects in the schema includes \\\"subjects: string or empty string\\\". In the card, the part after \\\"S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6]\\\". The subjects might be the series or classification. The rule says to extract the subject classifications or keywords. So perhaps \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" is the main subject, but the [Internationale Bibliothek...] is a series. However, the problem states to extract the subjects as the keywords. Maybe the subjects here are the terms in the brackets. Wait, but the [Internationale Bibliothek...] is a series, so maybe subjects are \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\".\\n\\nWait, the index card format typically lists the subject classification. The main title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\", so the angle brackets might indicate the subtitle, which is part of the title. The subjects might be the keywords. However, the rule states: subjects: Subject classifications or tags. So perhaps the subjects are the keywords related to the work. Given that, the subjects here might be \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" and \\\"Linguistik\\\" perhaps. But the instruction says to extract the subjects as listed. Let me check the original card:\\n\\n\\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen. [Illustr.] -- (M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]. -- 8' 298 S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6].\\\"\\n\\nWait, the part after \\\"S. = [...\\\" seems to be the series or collection to which this work belongs. So perhaps the subjects are \\\"Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6\\\". But the rule says \\\"Subject classifications or tags\\\", so maybe the subjects here are \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" as part of the title. Alternatively, the subjects might be \\\"Semiotik\\\" or other terms, but the card lists \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" in the title. Wait, the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". So the main title is the first part, and the subtitle is in angle brackets. The subjects might be the keywords, which would be the terms in the subtitle. However, sometimes the subjects are listed separately. The card doesn't have a clear separate line for subjects, so maybe the subjects are the terms in the angle brackets. But the user's instruction says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\", so perhaps they should be included. However, the problem states to extract the subjects as per the card. Let me check the example.\\n\\nWait, the user's schema for LibraryReference has \\\"subjects\\\" as a string. In the card, the line after the pages is \\\"S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6].\\\" which seems to indicate that this work is part of that series, so perhaps the subjects would be \\\"Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik\\\". But maybe it's better to take the subtitle as the subject. Alternatively, maybe the subjects are the keywords in the title. The card says \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" in the title's subtitle. So perhaps the subjects are that. But the instruction says to extract the subjects, so I'll go with \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" as the subjects. However, the card might have a different structure. Alternatively, the subjects could be the keywords from the series. Wait, the user's example in the schema shows \\\"subjects: string or empty string\\\", so perhaps the subjects here are \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\".\\n\\nWait, let's re-examine the card:\\n\\nThe author is Traban t, J\u00fcrgen. Title is Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009.\\n\\nSo the subtitle is in angle brackets, which might be considered the subject area. Therefore, the subjects would be \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\".\\n\\nNext, library reference shelfmark: \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" so shelfmark is \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\".\\n\\nNow, compiling all the information:\\n\\ntype: Dissertation or thesis (since no \\\"s.\\\" line)\\n\\nauthor: last_name \\\"Trabant\\\", first_name \\\"J\u00fcrgen\\\"\\n\\npublication:\\n\\ntitle: \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\"\\n\\nyear: 1971\\n\\nplace: \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\"\\n\\npages: \\\"298\\\" (removed S.)\\n\\npublisher: \\\"Pink\\\"\\n\\nformat: \\\"8'\\\"\\n\\nlibrary_reference:\\n\\nshelfmark: \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\"\\n\\nsubjects: \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the title also includes \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" in angle brackets. So maybe the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks (Glossematik und Literaturtheorie)\\\". But the user's instruction says title is the main title. The example in the schema shows the title as a string. The card lists \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". So the main title is the first part, and the subtitle is in angle brackets. However, sometimes the title includes the subtitle. The user's instruction says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So perhaps the title should be the entire title including the subtitle. Let me check.\\n\\nIn academic bibliographies, sometimes the main title is followed by a subtitle in angle brackets. For example, \\\"Title. (Subtitle)\\\". So the title here would be \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\", but the rule says to take the main title. However, since it's part of the title, perhaps it's included. Alternatively, maybe the main title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is part of it. But the user's schema requires the title as a single string. So it's safer to include the subtitle as part of the title.\\n\\nWait, the example card has \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009.\\\" so maybe the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is in angle brackets, but the main title is the first part. However, in the extraction rules, it's specified to take the main title. If the card lists the title with a subtitle in brackets, the main title would be the part before the brackets.\\n\\nWait, but the instruction says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So if the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the part in angle brackets is a subtitle, then the main title is the first part.\\n\\nAlternatively, the entire phrase after the author's name up to the \\\"Diss.\\\" part is the title. Let me check the card:\\n\\n\\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen. Zur Semiolgie des literari- schen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009. Diss.T\u00fcbingen. ...\\\"\\n\\nSo the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". But the dot before the angle brackets might be part of the title structure. In German, sometimes titles use periods and then a subtitle. However, the main title would be \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is \\\"\u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". But the extraction rules say to take the main title of the work. So probably, the title is the entire string, but that might not be the case. Wait, looking at similar examples, usually the title would include both parts. Alternatively, the main title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\". But since the rule says to take the main title, perhaps it's the first part.\\n\\nBut given the problem statement, the user's schema for publication has a \\\"title\\\" field. The example in the user's input shows that the title would be the main title. So I'll take the title as \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\", and the subtitle in angle brackets is part of the title. Wait, but the problem says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So the main title is the part before the subtitle. Therefore, the title should be \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\nWait, in German, sometimes the title is written with the subtitle as a separate part. For example, \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks: Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\". But here it's written with the subtitle in angle brackets. However, in the extraction rules, we're to extract the main title, so likely \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\nBut the user's example card has \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literari- schen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009.\\\" which seems like the main title is the first part, and the subtitle is in brackets. So the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\nTherefore, title: \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\"\\n\\nBut let me check if the title includes the subtitle. In many bibliographic formats, the subtitle is part of the title, but the rule says \\\"main title\\\". So perhaps the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is separate. However, given that the user's schema is expecting a single string for the title, and the example in the problem statement might include the subtitle, but according to the extraction rules, it's the main title. This is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the correct approach is to take the entire title as written, including the subtitle. However, the user's instructions for the publication title state: \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So if the work's title includes a subtitle in angle brackets, the main title would be the part before. Therefore, the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\nNext, pages: \\\"298\\\" (since the card says \\\"8' 298 S.\\\" and the rule says to remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix).\\n\\npublisher: The card lists \\\"(M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]\\\". So publisher is \\\"Pink\\\".\\n\\nformat: \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\nNow, the library reference subjects. The card has \\\"S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6]\\\". So the subjects might be the terms inside the brackets. But the rule says \\\"Subject classifications or keywords\\\". So perhaps the subjects are \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" as part of the title, but also the series. Wait, but the subjects field is for classifications or keywords. The angle brackets contain \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\", which are likely the main subject areas. Therefore, the subjects would be \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\".\\n\\nShelfmark: \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\".\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\ntype: \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\"\\n\\nauthor: {\\\"last_name\\\": \\\"Trabant\\\", \\\"first_name\\\": \\\"J\u00fcrgen\\\"}\\n\\npublication: {\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\",\\n  \\\"year\\\": 1971,\\n  \\\"place\\\": \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\",\\n  \\\"pages\\\": \\\"298\\\",\\n  \\\"publisher\\\": \\\"Pink\\\",\\n  \\\"format\\\": \\\"8'\\\"\\n}\\n\\nlibrary_reference: {\\n  \\\"shelfmark\\\": \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\",\\n  \\\"subjects\\\": \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, but in the card, the author's name is written as \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen\\\", which might be a typo. Should it be \\\"Trabant\\\"? The user probably intended \\\"Trabant\\\" but it's written as \\\"Traban t\\\". So we'll take \\\"Trabant\\\" as the last name. The first name is \\\"J\u00fcrgen\\\".\\n\\nAnother check: the card has \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" which indicates the dissertation was from T\u00fcbingen. So the place of publication might be \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\" instead of \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\". Wait, let's parse the publication details again.\\n\\nThe card says: \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen. [Illustr.] -- (M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]. -- 8' 298 S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6].\\\"\\n\\nHere, \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" likely indicates that the dissertation was completed at T\u00fcbingen. So place of publication for the dissertation would be \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\", while the publisher is in \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\" (Pink). Wait, the place field in the publication is \\\"Place of publication\\\", which for a dissertation might be the university town where it was defended. So \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\" would be the place.\\n\\nBut the rule says: \\\"place: Publication place\\\". So the place is where the publication was issued. In the case of a dissertation, the place is often the university city where it was written. So \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" indicates T\u00fcbingen is the place. So place should be \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\".\\n\\nWait, the standard structure is: \\\"Diss. [place]\\\". So \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" would mean the dissertation was from T\u00fcbingen. Therefore, the place of publication is \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\".\\n\\nSo correcting the place from \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\" to \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\".\\n\\nThen, publisher is \\\"Pink\\\" from \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\". So place is \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\", publisher is \\\"Pink\\\".\\n\\nWait, but the card says \\\"(M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]\\\". So the publisher is in M\u00fcnchen. But the place of publication for a dissertation might be the university, which is T\u00fcbingen, while the publisher is located in M\u00fcnchen. So the place field is T\u00fcbingen, and the publisher is Pink.\\n\\nYes, that's correct. For example, a dissertation from a university in T\u00fcbingen would have the place as T\u00fcbingen, even if published by a press in another city.\\n\\nSo updating place to \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\".\\n\\nTherefore, place: \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\"\\n\\nPublisher: \\\"Pink\\\"\\n\\nOkay, that's a correction.\\n\\nSo the publication details now:\\n\\ntitle: \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\"\\n\\nyear: 1971\\n\\nplace: \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\"\\n\\npages: \\\"298\\\"\\n\\npublisher: \\\"Pink\\\"\\n\\nformat: \\\"8'\\\"\\n\\nNow, checking the subjects again. The subjects field should be the subject classifications. The card mentions \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" in the title, which are likely the main subjects.

First, I need to extract the bibliographic information from the provided index card and format it into the specified JSON structure.\\n\\nStarting with the Card Type. The extraction rules say that if there's a note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it's a \\\"Reference\\\". Looking at the card, there's a line that says \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" and then \\\"Diss\\\" on the next line. Wait, the rule mentions \\\"s.\\\" but here it's \\\"Diss.\\\" Maybe that's a typo or different notation. Wait, the user's example shows \\\"s.\\\" as the indicator. Let me check the original card again.\\n\\nThe card has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" followed by \\\"Diss\\\" on a separate line. Hmm, the rule says \\\"if a card contains the note 's.' on a separate line, it is a Reference\\\". Wait, the example here has \\\"Diss.\\\" but maybe \\\"Diss.\\\" is part of the shelfmark. Wait, the user's instructions state that \\\"s.\\\" is the indicator. Wait, looking back: \\\"Card Type: If a card contains the note 's.' on a separate line, it is a 'Reference'. Otherwise, it is a 'Dissertation or thesis'.\\\"\\n\\nWait, the example index card provided in the user's message has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" and then \\\"Diss\\\" on the next line. Wait, maybe the \\\"s.\\\" part is elsewhere. Wait, looking at the card text:\\n\\nThe main text is: \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen.

The rule says if the card has \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it's a Reference. Wait, the user's example card has \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" and then \\\"Diss\\\" on the next line. Wait, maybe \\\"Diss\\\" is a typo for \\\"s.\\\"? Or perhaps \\\"Diss.\\\" is the abbreviation for \\\"Dissertation\\\", so the presence of \\\"Diss.\\\" indicates it's a Dissertation.\\n\\nWait, according to the extraction rules: if there's a note \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it's a Reference. Otherwise, it's Dissertation or thesis. So the presence of \\\"Diss\\\" in the text would indicate it's a Dissertation. Wait, in the card, there's \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" which is part of the publication details (Dissertation from T\u00fcbingen), and then \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" followed by \\\"Diss\\\" on a separate line.\\n\\nWait, maybe the \\\"s.\\\" is not present. The rule says if there's an \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line. Let's check the card again. The card's text includes \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" and then \\\"Diss\\\" on the next line. There's no line with \\\"s.\\\" here. The word \\\"Diss\\\" is present, but not \\\"s.\\\" So according to the rule, since there's no \\\"s.\\\" on a separate line, it's a Dissertation or thesis. So the type should be \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\".\\n\\nNext, the Author. The card says \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen.\\\" Wait, the name is written as \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen.\\\" with a space between Traban and t. Probably a typo, maybe it's \\\"Trabant\\\" but written as \\\"Traban t\\\". The author's name is likely \\\"Trabant, J\u00fcrgen\\\". However, the problem states: if only one name is given, put it in last_name and leave first_name empty. Here, it's \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen\\\" which seems to be a misspelling of \\\"Trabant\\\", so last_name is \\\"Trabant\\\", first_name \\\"J\u00fcrgen\\\".\\n\\nNext, Publication details:\\n\\n- title: The main title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". Wait, the title might be the main work, which is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" with the subtitle in angle brackets. The rule says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So probably \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\n- year: [1971] is present. The year should be 1971 as integer.\\n\\n- place: \\\"(M\u00fcnchen)\\\" is listed here as the publisher's place. Wait, in the text it's \\\"(M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971].\\\". So place is \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\".\\n\\n- pages: \\\"8' 298 S.\\\" The rule says to remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix if present. So pages should be \\\"298\\\".\\n\\n- publisher: \\\"Pink\\\" (since it's (M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971].) Wait, the publisher is \\\"Pink\\\" as per the text. Wait, the structure is (place):publisher [year]. So \\\"(M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971].\\\" so publisher is \\\"Pink\\\".\\n\\n- format: \\\"8'\\\". The format is specified as \\\"8'\\\" in the text.\\n\\nLibrary Reference:\\n\\n- shelfmark: \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" \u2013 shelfmark is \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\".\\n\\n- subjects: The subjects are listed as \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\", but also \\\"[Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6]\\\". However, the rule says subjects are \\\"Subject classifications or keywords\\\". The main subject here might be \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\", but maybe the subjects are the keywords in the brackets. Wait, the card says \\\"8' 298 S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6]\\\". So the subjects could be the \\\"Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6\\\" but perhaps it's part of the library catalog entry. The subjects might be the keywords listed. The rule says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\". The text has \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" in angle brackets, which might be the title of the work, not the subjects. Wait, the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". So the title has a subtitle. But the subjects might be the keywords here. Alternatively, the subjects could be the \\\"Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6\\\" part. Wait, the user's example for subjects in the schema includes \\\"subjects: string or empty string\\\". In the card, the part after \\\"S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6]\\\". The subjects might be the series or classification. The rule says to extract the subject classifications or keywords. So perhaps \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" is the main subject, but the [Internationale Bibliothek...] is a series. However, the problem states to extract the subjects as the keywords. Maybe the subjects here are the terms in the brackets. Wait, but the [Internationale Bibliothek...] is a series, so maybe subjects are \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\".\\n\\nWait, the index card format typically lists the subject classification. The main title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\", so the angle brackets might indicate the subtitle, which is part of the title. The subjects might be the keywords. However, the rule states: subjects: Subject classifications or tags. So perhaps the subjects are the keywords related to the work. Given that, the subjects here might be \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" and \\\"Linguistik\\\" perhaps. But the instruction says to extract the subjects as listed. Let me check the original card:\\n\\n\\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen. [Illustr.] -- (M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]. -- 8' 298 S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6].\\\"\\n\\nWait, the part after \\\"S. = [...\\\" seems to be the series or collection to which this work belongs. So perhaps the subjects are \\\"Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6\\\". But the rule says \\\"Subject classifications or tags\\\", so maybe the subjects here are \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" as part of the title. Alternatively, the subjects might be \\\"Semiotik\\\" or other terms, but the card lists \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" in the title. Wait, the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". So the main title is the first part, and the subtitle is in angle brackets. The subjects might be the keywords, which would be the terms in the subtitle. However, sometimes the subjects are listed separately. The card doesn't have a clear separate line for subjects, so maybe the subjects are the terms in the angle brackets. But the user's instruction says \\\"subjects: Subject classifications or keywords\\\", so perhaps they should be included. However, the problem states to extract the subjects as per the card. Let me check the example.\\n\\nWait, the user's schema for LibraryReference has \\\"subjects\\\" as a string. In the card, the line after the pages is \\\"S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6].\\\" which seems to indicate that this work is part of that series, so perhaps the subjects would be \\\"Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik\\\". But maybe it's better to take the subtitle as the subject. Alternatively, maybe the subjects are the keywords in the title. The card says \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" in the title's subtitle. So perhaps the subjects are that. But the instruction says to extract the subjects, so I'll go with \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" as the subjects. However, the card might have a different structure. Alternatively, the subjects could be the keywords from the series. Wait, the user's example in the schema shows \\\"subjects: string or empty string\\\", so perhaps the subjects here are \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\".\\n\\nWait, let's re-examine the card:\\n\\nThe author is Traban t, J\u00fcrgen. Title is Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009.\\n\\nSo the subtitle is in angle brackets, which might be considered the subject area. Therefore, the subjects would be \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\".\\n\\nNext, library reference shelfmark: \\\"Standort: Diss.1971,888\\\" so shelfmark is \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\".\\n\\nNow, compiling all the information:\\n\\ntype: Dissertation or thesis (since no \\\"s.\\\" line)\\n\\nauthor: last_name \\\"Trabant\\\", first_name \\\"J\u00fcrgen\\\"\\n\\npublication:\\n\\ntitle: \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\"\\n\\nyear: 1971\\n\\nplace: \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\"\\n\\npages: \\\"298\\\" (removed S.)\\n\\npublisher: \\\"Pink\\\"\\n\\nformat: \\\"8'\\\"\\n\\nlibrary_reference:\\n\\nshelfmark: \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\"\\n\\nsubjects: \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\"\\n\\nWait, but the title also includes \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" in angle brackets. So maybe the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks (Glossematik und Literaturtheorie)\\\". But the user's instruction says title is the main title. The example in the schema shows the title as a string. The card lists \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". So the main title is the first part, and the subtitle is in angle brackets. However, sometimes the title includes the subtitle. The user's instruction says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So perhaps the title should be the entire title including the subtitle. Let me check.\\n\\nIn academic bibliographies, sometimes the main title is followed by a subtitle in angle brackets. For example, \\\"Title. (Subtitle)\\\". So the title here would be \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\", but the rule says to take the main title. However, since it's part of the title, perhaps it's included. Alternatively, maybe the main title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is part of it. But the user's schema requires the title as a single string. So it's safer to include the subtitle as part of the title.\\n\\nWait, the example card has \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009.\\\" so maybe the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is in angle brackets, but the main title is the first part. However, in the extraction rules, it's specified to take the main title. If the card lists the title with a subtitle in brackets, the main title would be the part before the brackets.\\n\\nWait, but the instruction says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So if the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the part in angle brackets is a subtitle, then the main title is the first part.\\n\\nAlternatively, the entire phrase after the author's name up to the \\\"Diss.\\\" part is the title. Let me check the card:\\n\\n\\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen. Zur Semiolgie des literari- schen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009. Diss.T\u00fcbingen. ...\\\"\\n\\nSo the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". But the dot before the angle brackets might be part of the title structure. In German, sometimes titles use periods and then a subtitle. However, the main title would be \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is \\\"\u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009\\\". But the extraction rules say to take the main title of the work. So probably, the title is the entire string, but that might not be the case. Wait, looking at similar examples, usually the title would include both parts. Alternatively, the main title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\". But since the rule says to take the main title, perhaps it's the first part.\\n\\nBut given the problem statement, the user's schema for publication has a \\\"title\\\" field. The example in the user's input shows that the title would be the main title. So I'll take the title as \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\", and the subtitle in angle brackets is part of the title. Wait, but the problem says \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So the main title is the part before the subtitle. Therefore, the title should be \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\nWait, in German, sometimes the title is written with the subtitle as a separate part. For example, \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks: Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\". But here it's written with the subtitle in angle brackets. However, in the extraction rules, we're to extract the main title, so likely \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\nBut the user's example card has \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literari- schen Kunstwerks. \u3008Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\u3009.\\\" which seems like the main title is the first part, and the subtitle is in brackets. So the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\nTherefore, title: \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\"\\n\\nBut let me check if the title includes the subtitle. In many bibliographic formats, the subtitle is part of the title, but the rule says \\\"main title\\\". So perhaps the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\" and the subtitle is separate. However, given that the user's schema is expecting a single string for the title, and the example in the problem statement might include the subtitle, but according to the extraction rules, it's the main title. This is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the correct approach is to take the entire title as written, including the subtitle. However, the user's instructions for the publication title state: \\\"title: The main title of the work\\\". So if the work's title includes a subtitle in angle brackets, the main title would be the part before. Therefore, the title is \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\".\\n\\nNext, pages: \\\"298\\\" (since the card says \\\"8' 298 S.\\\" and the rule says to remove \\\"S.\\\" suffix).\\n\\npublisher: The card lists \\\"(M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]\\\". So publisher is \\\"Pink\\\".\\n\\nformat: \\\"8'\\\".\\n\\nNow, the library reference subjects. The card has \\\"S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6]\\\". So the subjects might be the terms inside the brackets. But the rule says \\\"Subject classifications or keywords\\\". So perhaps the subjects are \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\" as part of the title, but also the series. Wait, but the subjects field is for classifications or keywords. The angle brackets contain \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\", which are likely the main subject areas. Therefore, the subjects would be \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\".\\n\\nShelfmark: \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\".\\n\\nPutting it all together:\\n\\ntype: \\\"Dissertation or thesis\\\"\\n\\nauthor: {\\\"last_name\\\": \\\"Trabant\\\", \\\"first_name\\\": \\\"J\u00fcrgen\\\"}\\n\\npublication: {\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\",\\n  \\\"year\\\": 1971,\\n  \\\"place\\\": \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\",\\n  \\\"pages\\\": \\\"298\\\",\\n  \\\"publisher\\\": \\\"Pink\\\",\\n  \\\"format\\\": \\\"8'\\\"\\n}\\n\\nlibrary_reference: {\\n  \\\"shelfmark\\\": \\\"Diss.1971,888\\\",\\n  \\\"subjects\\\": \\\"Glossematik und Literaturtheorie\\\"\\n}\\n\\nWait, but in the card, the author's name is written as \\\"Traban t, J\u00fcrgen\\\", which might be a typo. Should it be \\\"Trabant\\\"? The user probably intended \\\"Trabant\\\" but it's written as \\\"Traban t\\\". So we'll take \\\"Trabant\\\" as the last name. The first name is \\\"J\u00fcrgen\\\".\\n\\nAnother check: the card has \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" which indicates the dissertation was from T\u00fcbingen. So the place of publication might be \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\" instead of \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\". Wait, let's parse the publication details again.\\n\\nThe card says: \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen. [Illustr.] -- (M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]. -- 8' 298 S. = [Internationale Bibliothek f\u00fcr allgemeine Linguistik,Bd.6].\\\"\\n\\nHere, \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" likely indicates that the dissertation was completed at T\u00fcbingen. So place of publication for the dissertation would be \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\", while the publisher is in \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\" (Pink). Wait, the place field in the publication is \\\"Place of publication\\\", which for a dissertation might be the university town where it was defended. So \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\" would be the place.\\n\\nBut the rule says: \\\"place: Publication place\\\". So the place is where the publication was issued. In the case of a dissertation, the place is often the university city where it was written. So \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" indicates T\u00fcbingen is the place. So place should be \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\".\\n\\nWait, the standard structure is: \\\"Diss. [place]\\\". So \\\"Diss.T\u00fcbingen\\\" would mean the dissertation was from T\u00fcbingen. Therefore, the place of publication is \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\".\\n\\nSo correcting the place from \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\" to \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\".\\n\\nThen, publisher is \\\"Pink\\\" from \\\"M\u00fcnchen\\\". So place is \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\", publisher is \\\"Pink\\\".\\n\\nWait, but the card says \\\"(M\u00fcnchen):Pink [1971]\\\". So the publisher is in M\u00fcnchen. But the place of publication for a dissertation might be the university, which is T\u00fcbingen, while the publisher is located in M\u00fcnchen. So the place field is T\u00fcbingen, and the publisher is Pink.\\n\\nYes, that's correct. For example, a dissertation from a university in T\u00fcbingen would have the place as T\u00fcbingen, even if published by a press in another city.\\n\\nSo updating place to \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\".\\n\\nTherefore, place: \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\"\\n\\nPublisher: \\\"Pink\\\"\\n\\nOkay, that's a correction.\\n\\nSo the publication details now:\\n\\ntitle: \\\"Zur Semiolgie des literarischen Kunstwerks\\\"\\n\\nyear: 1971\\n\\nplace: \\\"T\u00fcbingen\\\"\\n\\npages: \\\"298\\\"\\n\\npublisher: \\\"Pink\\\"\\n\\nformat: \\\"8'\\\"\\n\\nNow, checking the subjects again.
