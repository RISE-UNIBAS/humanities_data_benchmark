The user provided three images of a letter, and I need to parse the required fields: letter_title, sender_persons, send_date, receiver_persons.\\n\\nFirst, let's recall the requirements:\\n\\n- All values must be stored as lists (even if a single value).\\n- Dates must be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).\\n- If info is missing, set to \\\"null\\\".\\n- Don't use OCR, but analyze the text from the images.\\n\\nStarting with the first image:\\n\\nTop of the first page shows:\\n- \\\"Basler Rheinschiffahrt-Aktiengesellschaft\\\"\\n- Address: Marktgasse 5III, Basel\\n- Date: \\\"Basel, den 16. Februar 1926.\\\" \u2192 This is the send_date. Need to convert to ISO. 16th February 1926 \u2192 1926-02-16.\\n- Receiver: \\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co., Basel, Kaufhausgasse 7.\\\" \u2192 So receiver_persons would be [\\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co.\\\"]\\n- Sender: The letter is from \\\"Basler Rheinschiffahrt-Aktiengesellschaft\\\", but looking at the signatures on the third page: \\\"hochachtend BASELER RHEINSCHIFFAHRT-AKTIEGSELLSCHAFT\\\" with signatures \\\"G\u00fcnther\\\" and \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\". Also, the copie section says \\\"Copie: Herrn Ryniker, Schiffbau-Ingenieur Basel, Herrn Dr. Krasting, Basel.\\\" So the sender_persons should be the company name? Wait, the sender_persons key is for \\\"Name(s) of the person(s) who wrote the letter\\\". But the letter is from a company, so maybe the company is the sender, but the individuals signing it are the representatives. Wait, the instructions say \\\"person(s) who wrote the letter\\\" \u2014 so perhaps the signatories. On the third page, it's signed by two people: \\\"G\u00fcnther\\\" and \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\". Wait, let's check the third image:\\n\\nThird page: \\\"hochachtend BASELER RHEINSCHIFFAHRT-AKTIEGSELLSCHAFT\\\" followed by two signatures: \\\"G\u00fcnther\\\" and \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\". So the sender_persons would be [\\\"G\u00fcnther\\\", \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\"]? Or is the company the sender, but the task says \\\"person(s) who wrote the letter\\\". Typically, company letters are signed by individuals, so the signatories are the persons.\\n\\nWait, let's check the first page again. The company name is at the top: \\\"Basler Rheinschiffahrt-Aktiengesellschaft\\\", so that's the sender organization. The individuals who wrote the letter would be the signatories. Looking at the third page, after the company name, it's signed by \\\"G\u00fcnther\\\" and \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\". So sender_persons would be those two names.\\n\\nNow, letter_title: The title of the letter. The letter discusses a new boat (Vogel-Gryff) and collaboration with Christ & Co. So the letter is about proposing collaboration on a passenger boat. Maybe \\\"Proposals for Collaboration on Passenger Boat Operation\\\" or similar. But since it's a formal letter, maybe the title is implied by the content. However, the example had \\\"Petition for Environmental Protection\\\" as title. Here, the letter is about a boat project, so letter_title could be [\\\"Proposal for Collaboration on New Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff'\\\"].\\n\\nReceiver_persons: As seen in the address: \\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co.\\\" \u2192 So receiver_persons is [\\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co.\\\"]\\n\\nsend_date: \\\"16. Februar 1926\\\" \u2192 1926-02-16.\\n\\nNow, let's check each key:\\n\\nletter_title: Need to find a title. The letter is from the company to Herrn Christ regarding a new boat. The key points are about ordering a diesel motorboat, collaboration, etc. Maybe \\\"Letter Regarding Proposed Collaboration on Passenger Boat Operations\\\" but perhaps the title is more specific. Looking at the third page, it mentions \\\"Unser Boot soll 'Vogel - Gryff' heissen\\\" \u2192 so the letter is about the boat named Vogel-Gryff. So letter_title could be [\\\"Proposal for Collaboration on Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff'\\\"].\\n\\nsender_persons: The signatories are G\u00fcnther and Dr. R\u00fcller. Check the third image: signatures are \\\"G\u00fcnther\\\" and \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\". So sender_persons is [\\\"G\u00fcnther\\\", \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\"].\\n\\nsend_date: 1926-02-16.\\n\\nreceiver_persons: The address is \\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co.\\\" \u2192 so [\\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co.\\\"].\\n\\nWait, but let's check the second image: there's \\\"Herrn Christ, Basel. 16.2.26.\\\" which confirms the date.\\n\\nAlso, the copie line says \\\"Copie: Herrn Ryniker, Schiffbau-Ingenieur Basel, Herrn Dr. Krasting, Basel.\\\" \u2192 so those are copies to, but receiver_persons is the primary receiver. The main receiver is Herrn Christ.\\n\\nNow, confirm each field:\\n\\n- send_date: \\\"16. Februar 1926\\\" \u2192 ISO is 1926-02-16.\\n\\n- receiver_persons: The address starts with \\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co., Basel, Kaufhausgasse 7.\\\" \u2192 So the receiver is Herrn Christ, but the company name is part of it. So it's [\\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co.\\\"] as the receiver.\\n\\n- sender_persons: The letter is from Basler Rheinschiffahrt-Aktiengesellschaft, signed by G\u00fcnther and Dr. R\u00fcller. So sender_persons is [\\\"G\u00fcnther\\\", \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\"].\\n\\n- letter_title: The letter discusses the boat project. The title could be something like \\\"Proposal for Collaboration on Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff'\\\".\\n\\nWait, but the user's example had a title like \\\"Petition for Environmental Protection\\\". Here, the title is the subject. Let's see if there's a specific title. Since the letter is about proposing collaboration on a new boat, maybe the title is \\\"Proposal for Collaboration on New Passenger Boat\\\".\\n\\nBut maybe the title is implied by the letter's content. Alternatively, in historical letters, the title might not be explicit, so perhaps we have to derive it. However, in the absence of an explicit title, but since the instructions say \\\"Title of the letter\\\", perhaps the letter's content's main subject is the title.\\n\\nLooking at the first page, the first paragraph: \\\"Durch Herrn Ryniker/Dr. Max Vischer haben Sie wahrscheinlich erfahren, dass unsere Gesellschaft ein Dieselmotorboot bestellt hat. Das Boot wird \u00e4hnlich gebaut wie Ihr Passagierboot 'Rheinfelden'.\\\"\\n\\nThe letter is about the company ordering a boat, similar to their customer's (Christ & Co.) boat, and discussing collaboration.\\n\\nThe third page states: \\\"Unser Boot soll 'Vogel - Gryff' heissen.\\\" and talks about collaboration.\\n\\nSo the title could be \\\"Letter Regarding New Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff' and Collaboration with Christ & Co.\\\"\\n\\nBut since the task says \\\"Title of the letter\\\", and in business letters, the title might be omitted. However, in the example, the title was a specific phrase. So perhaps the title is derived from the main subject.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the letter has a title, but in the images, it's not explicitly stated. Wait, looking at the first image, the top left has the company name, but there's no \\\"Subject:\\\" or \\\"Title:\\\" line. So perhaps the letter_title is the subject of the communication.\\n\\nGiven that, the letter_title would be something like \\\"Proposal for Collaboration on Passenger Boat Construction\\\".\\n\\nBut let's check the exact content. The letter is from Basler Rheinschiffahrt-Aktiengesellschaft to Herrn Christ, discussing a new boat they ordered (similar to the Rheinfelden), and wanting to collaborate with Christ & Co. for passenger transport.\\n\\nThe key event is proposing collaboration on the boat named Vogel-Gryff. So the title could be \\\"Proposal for Collaboration on the Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff'\\\".\\n\\nYes, that seems appropriate.\\n\\nNow, checking all fields:\\n\\n- send_date: 1926-02-16.\\n\\n- receiver_persons: The address is \\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co.\\\" \u2192 so as a list, [\\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs.

The letter is from the company, but the individuals who wrote it (i.e., the ones who signed) are G\u00fcnther and Dr. R\u00fcller. Yes, because the company's letter is signed by those two people.\\n\\nAnother thing to check: the date. The first image has \\\"Basel, den 16. Februar 1926.\\\" \u2192 February 16, 1926 \u2192 1926-02-16.\\n\\nYes, ISO format.\\n\\nNow, check if all required fields are present:\\n\\n- send_date: present.\\n\\n- letter_title: derived from content.\\n\\n- sender_persons: the signatories.\\n\\n- receiver_persons: the address.\\n\\nAre there any missing fields? The example includes all four, and the schema requires them.\\n\\nNow, let's make sure about the receiver_persons. The address is \\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co., Basel, Kaufhausgasse 7.\\\" So the receiver is Herrn Christ, with the company name (i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co.), so combining them into a string.\\n\\nSimilarly, the sender_persons: the two signatories.\\n\\nLet's check if there's any other possible sender. The company is Basler Rheinschiffahrt-Aktiengesellschaft, but the sender_persons is the person(s) who wrote the letter, so the signatories.\\n\\nYes, that makes sense.\\n\\nNow, the JSON structure:\\n\\nThe schema requires:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"metadata\\\": {\\n    \\\"send_date\\\": [...],\\n    \\\"letter_title\\\": [...],\\n    \\\"sender_persons\\\": [...],\\n    \\\"receiver_persons\\\": [...]\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nSo the keys are all under \\\"metadata\\\", and each is a list.\\n\\nLet's put it all together.\\n\\nsend_date: [\\\"1926-02-16\\\"]\\n\\nletter_title: [\\\"Proposal for Collaboration on Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff'\\\"]\\n\\nsender_persons: [\\\"G\u00fcnther\\\", \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\"]\\n\\nreceiver_persons: [\\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs. Paravicini, Christ & Co.\\\"]\\n\\nWait, but let's check the second image: \\\"Herrn Christ, Basel. 16.2.26.\\\" so the date is consistent.\\n\\nAlso, the third image says \\\"Copie: Herrn Ryniker, Schiffbau-Ingenieur Basel, Herrn Dr. Krasting, Basel.\\\" But those are copies to, so not part of receiver_persons (which is the primary recipient).\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, let's confirm the date format. \\\"16. Februar 1926\\\" \u2192 ISO is 1926-02-16.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, the title: Is there a specific title in the letter? Since the letter is a business letter, it might not have a title, but the example shows that the title is a phrase derived from the content. So the title is \\\"Proposal for Collaboration on Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff'\\\".\\n\\nAnother check: the letter says \\\"Unser Boot soll 'Vogel - Gryff' heissen.\\\" \u2192 \\\"Our boat shall be called 'Vogel - Gryff'.\\\" So the title includes that.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo final JSON:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"metadata\\\": {\\n    \\\"send_date\\\": [\\\"1926-02-16\\\"],\\n    \\\"letter_title\\\": [\\\"Proposal for Collaboration on Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff'\\\"],\\n    \\\"sender_persons\\\": [\\\"G\u00fcnther\\\", \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\"],\\n    \\\"receiver_persons\\\": [\\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs.

Februar 1926\\\" \u2192 ISO is 1926-02-16.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, the title: Is there a specific title in the letter? Since the letter is a business letter, it might not have a title, but the example shows that the title is a phrase derived from the content. So the title is \\\"Proposal for Collaboration on Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff'\\\".\\n\\nAnother check: the letter says \\\"Unser Boot soll 'Vogel - Gryff' heissen.\\\" \u2192 \\\"Our boat shall be called 'Vogel - Gryff'.\\\" So the title includes that.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo final JSON:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"metadata\\\": {\\n    \\\"send_date\\\": [\\\"1926-02-16\\\"],\\n    \\\"letter_title\\\": [\\\"Proposal for Collaboration on Passenger Boat 'Vogel - Gryff'\\\"],\\n    \\\"sender_persons\\\": [\\\"G\u00fcnther\\\", \\\"Dr. R\u00fcller\\\"],\\n    \\\"receiver_persons\\\": [\\\"Herrn Christ, i/Fs.
