FIELD EXTRACTION RULES:

**diplomatic_transcript** (REQUIRED for all fields):
- Transcribe EXACTLY as written on the card
- Include all abbreviations, punctuation, and formatting as they appear
- Preserve original capitalization and spacing
- Include currency symbols and separators (e.g., "Fr. 2'400.-", "3.700.-")
- For dates, copy the exact format (e.g., "1. Jan. 1946", "1.April 1945")
- Use empty string "" for empty cells
- Be sure to escape ditto marks (repetition marks such as `"` indicating "same as above")
- DO NOT expand abbreviations or standardize formats
- Do not transcribe checkmarks

**interpretation** (OPTIONAL - use null if not applicable):
- For ditto marks (repetition marks such as `"`): Replace with the actual repeated value from the previous row in the same column
  - For example, if previous row's dienstliche_stellung is "Hilfsleiterin" and current row has `"`, interpret as "Hilfsleiterin"
  - Do NOT add explanatory text like "wie oben" or similar - just provide the repeated value
- Never expand abbreviations
- For dates: Convert to ISO format YYYY-MM-DD
  - "1. Jan. 1946" → "1946-01-01"
  - "1.April 1945" → "1945-04-01"
- For salary amounts: Extract numeric value only (remove currency symbols, separators)
  - "Fr. 2'400.-" → "2400"
  - "3.700.-" → "3700"
  - "5.094.-" → "5094"
  "6,30.-" → "6.3"
- For salary class: Convert roman numerals to arabic if clear
  - "III" → "3"
  - "IV" → "4"
- Do not convert roman numerals to arabic if not salary, date, or salary class
- Use null if no interpretation/expansion is needed or if the field is empty
- "+ {word}" where {word} is a word does not need interpretation

**is_crossed_out** (REQUIRED for all fields):
- Set to true if text in this field is crossed out, struck through, or deleted
- Set to false if text is normal (not crossed out)
- Empty cells should have is_crossed_out: false

ROW HANDLING:
- Number rows sequentially starting from 1 (top to bottom)
- Include ALL rows that have ANY content in ANY column
- Empty rows (all cells empty) should be omitted
- A row with only one filled cell should still be included

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanation
- Every field must have all three sub-fields: diplomatic_transcript, interpretation, is_crossed_out
- diplomatic_transcript must never be null (use empty string "" for empty cells)
- interpretation can be null when no expansion/standardization applies
- Process the entire table from top to bottom
- Maintain consistent row numbering throughout
