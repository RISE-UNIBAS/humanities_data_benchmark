# medieval_manuscripts
This directory contains a collection of medieval manuscript images used for benchmarking image processing and analysis algorithms. The dataset includes high-resolution scans of various manuscripts, along with metadata such as the manuscript's origin, date, and content description.

## Overview
Evaluates models on page segmentation and handwritten text extraction from 15th century medieval manuscripts written in late medieval German. Tests the ability to transcribe historical handwriting, identify folio numbers, distinguish main text from marginal additions, and maintain historical spelling and formatting. Performance is measured using fuzzy string matching and Character Error Rate (CER).
