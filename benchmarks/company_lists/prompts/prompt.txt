The image you are presented with stems from a digitized book containing lists of companies.
Your task is to extract structured information about each company listed on the page.

About the source:
- The image stems from a trade index of the British Swiss Chamber of Commerce.
- The image can show an alphabetical or a thematic list of companies.
- The companies are mostly located in Switzerland and the UK.
- The image stems from a trade index between 1925 and 1958.
- Most pages have one column but some years have two columns.
- The source itself is in English and German but the company names can be in English, German, French or Italian.

About the entries:
- Each entry describes a single company or person.
- Alphabetical entries have filling dots between the company name and the page number. Dots and page numbers are not part of the data and should be ignored.
- Alphabetical entries seldom to never have locations.
- Thematic entries often have locations.
- Thematic entries are listed under headings that describe the type of business.
- Some thematic headings are only references to other headings, e.g. "X, s. Y".

About the output:
- Answer in valid JSON. The JSON should be an array of objects with the following fields:
- The page ID is given as {page_id}.

{
  "entry_id": "A unique identifier for the entry, e.g. '{page_id}-1'",
  "company_name": "The name of the company or person",
  "location": "The location of the company, e.g. 'Zurich' or 'London, UK'. If no location is given, set to null.",
  "industry": "The industry of the company, e.g. 'Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products'. If no industry is given, set to null.",
  "additional_information": [
    # Any additional information about the company, e.g. 'address', 'phone', 'telegraph', 'telegrams'
    {"type": "phone" "value": "123456789"},
    {"type": "address" "value": "Some street 1, Zurich"}
  ]
}
