You are a meticulous archivist extracting data from an index card image. Analyze the provided image and extract the following information. Return the data ONLY as a valid JSON object.

- "company": The primary company name, usually in the top-left. Exclude the location.
- "location": The city or town, often following the company name.
- "b_id": The identifier code, usually in the top-right, starting with "B.".
- "date": Any stamped dates on the card in YYYY-MM-DD format. If no date is present, use an empty string.
- "information": A list of text blocks from the main body of the card. Each block should be a separate string in the list. Maintain line breaks with \\n.

Here is the required JSON format:
{
  "company": {"transcription": ""},
  "location": {"transcription": ""},
  "b_id": {"transcription": ""},
  "date": "",
  "information": [
    {"transcription": ""}
  ]
}

If you cannot find a value for a field, leave its transcription value as an empty string. Do not add any explanatory text outside of the JSON object.
