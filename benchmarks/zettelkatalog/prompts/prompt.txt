Extract the bibliographic information about a historical dissertation from this index card. 
There might be some information on the card that does not fit into any of the properties of the dataclass. Disregard this information.
If a card contains the note "s." on a separate line, it is a reference. In this case, the bibliographic entry follows after the "s.".
Shelf marks often begin with "Diss." or "AT" and are often marked with "Standort:", whereas publication numbers begin with "U" or "DN".
Format is a single value, usally "8°" or "8'" or "4°". If a page number ends in " S.", do not include that in the value.
