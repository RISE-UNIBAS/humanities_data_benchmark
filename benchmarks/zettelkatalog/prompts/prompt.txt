   - year: Publication year as integer
   - place: Publication place
   - pages: Page count (remove " S." suffix if present)
   - publisher: Publishing house/institution
   - format: Usually "8°", "8'", or "4°" - single value only

4. **Library Reference**:
   - shelfmark: Often begins with "Diss." or "AT", may be marked with "Standort:"
   - subjects: Subject classifications or keywords

5. **Missing Information**: Use empty string "" for missing text fields, omit year fields entirely if not present.

6. **Ignore**: Disregard any information that doesn't fit into these categories.
